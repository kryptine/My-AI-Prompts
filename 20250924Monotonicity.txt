Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now, it's just incremental. Can you please attempt to use Rice's theorem to prove the fact that the only social choice functions that are nice according to Arrow's definition are dictatorial, even when there are infinitely many players, by adapting the proofs in paper 2 and paper 4, and apply Arrow's impossibility theorem to the results of paper 1? Can you please use Roberts' diagonal argument for magmoidal categories to give a more direct proof of Godel's first incompleteness theorem and therefore Arrow's impossibility theorem? What do these results apply for AI alignment when preference aggregation is subject to Arrow's theorem and all learning methods satisfy local pairwise monotonicity, thus causing local cycles?
