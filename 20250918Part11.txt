Write Part 11 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the precise formal forms and proofs of Wentworth's good regulator theorem at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Dx9LoqsEh3gHNJMDk/fixing-the-good-regulator-theorem and his unification of utility maximization and description length minimization based on prefix codes as used in Huffman and arithmetic coding satisfying Kraft's inequality, allowing representation of probabilities as demonstrated at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/voLHQgNncnjjgAPH7/utility-maximization-description-length-minimization as well as the following papers:
1. Why language models hallucinate https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04664v1
2. Predictable compression failures: why language models actually hallucinate https://arxiv.org/html/2509.11208v1
3. On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models https://arxiv.org/html/2506.06382v6 since they all show that fixing errors like hallucination and alignment are a matter of modeling (according to the good regulator theorem, reinforcement learning and data curation) and adjustment, by using the equivalence between utility maximization and description length minimization to show that "prices/utility are signals/information" in economics according to Shannon's noisy channel capacity theorem and source compression theorems which all show that information channels and data are like supply and demand, which can be priced according to the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem, which shows that when valuations overlap, you can compute the cross-entropy loss and price the mechanism designer's wish for efficient trade to break his budget balance.
In addition, can you please help me formalize these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by first mathematically unifying the descriptions in the three papers about the impossibility of hallucination along the following independent dimensions: the pre-training phase, the post-training phase, by showing how the post-training phase corresponds to the mechanism chosen in the Green-Laffont impossibility theorem, and explaining how Polish spaces model the pre-training and post-training processes, explicitly defining the basic concepts of the paper (Godel-Lob provability logic for Lob's theorem, S modal logic for Payor's lemma, probabilistic modal logic, the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later?
