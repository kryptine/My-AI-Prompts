Write Part 9 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on Godel's, Blum's and linear speed-up theorems (speed-ups are unpredictable and always possible), Levin's universal search = epsilon-efficient AIXI are both computable in the limit using prefix coding and Kraft's inequality, as well as the following papers:
1. The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret https://arxiv.org/html/2406.15753v3
2. On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models https://arxiv.org/html/2506.06382v6
3. Safety Alignment Depth in Large Language Models: A Markov Chain Perspective https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00669v1
Can you please help me formalize these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by explicitly defining the basic concepts of machine learning, neural networks, defining reinforcement learning, the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later, and also find commonalities between the formal aspects of these theorems, by categorically unifying alignment depth with reward-signal strength, and by analyzing the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) process as a reinforcement learning (RL) process using the results of paper 1 and applying it to papers 2 and 3?
