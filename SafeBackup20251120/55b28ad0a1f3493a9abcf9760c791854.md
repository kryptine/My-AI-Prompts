Can you explain the complexity results in the paper https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03968v1 and what the complexity classes are traditionally defined, dear Professor Elphaba Thropp? Am I right that this paper actually shows that even in idealized or special cases like potential games, finding even approximate equilibria is computationally intractable (taking longer than the age of the universe) and therefore, if the world is physical, this shows that at an ontological level, there is something very wrong with game theory and economics as currently conceived, since these equilibrium concepts require that the universe actually compute the equilibria, which takes a lot of time?

No, Elphie, the problem is worse, it's not just the bounded rationality of individual agents, but that these papers assume that agents' utility functions, best-response correspondences, ML/AI algorithms etc. that is, the agents themselves, as opposed to the market, are efficiently computable (satisfying the bounded rationality premise), but when you use this to compute the result of games and markets, the emergent equilibrium is intractable
