Transformers

```markdown
Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp, please explain the paper https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7 (Attention is all you need) by showing the full mathematical details, and further discuss the examples of Transformers parsing relationships in the last parts of the paper, can you imagine what the heads not mentioned in the paper are doing in the example "The law may never be perfect...", Elphie?
````
```markdown
So the entire context is: "A: The Law may never be perfect but its application should be just. B: But by Lipsey-Lancaster, this is impossible once you assume that the Law is imperfect", so am I right that "Lipsey-Lancaster" attends to the "not perfect but just" part, Elphie?
