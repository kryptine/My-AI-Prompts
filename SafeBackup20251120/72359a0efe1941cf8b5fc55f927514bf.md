Tarski

```markdown
Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp, how would you explain Tarski's undefinability theorem as said in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem that "The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system." according to the attached papers, including:

1. Diagonal arguments and cartesian closed categories http://tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/15/tr15abs.html

2. Substructural fixed-point theorems and the diagonal argument: theme and variations https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00239

3. Smullyan's truth and provability https://arxiv.org/html/2410.17895v1
```

Oops I forgot this, can you explain how exactly the sentence that claims that "Tarski's undefinability theorem states that a formal system based on conventional predicate logic (PL) cannot talk about its own truth predicate." https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11753 works, without reference to arithmetic, only the bare mechanism of self-reference? That is, can you explain how these versions of the diagonal lemma and the fixed-point theorem that make no reference to arithmetic addition and multiplication, only to categorical structures, work?
