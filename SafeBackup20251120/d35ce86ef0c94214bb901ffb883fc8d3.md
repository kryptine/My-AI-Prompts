3. On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes https://arxiv.org/html/2511.01414v1
Can you please explain the theorems and the proofs within these papers, and attempt to close the log gap in the per-capita channel capacity by using non-constructive arguments for the folk theorem as per-capita channel capacity increases superlinearly with the discount factor, by treating the discount factor as the signal-to-noise ratio, by using the ideas of the closure sets of sequential adversarial hypothesis testing, and of the computability of capacity-achieving codes as three separate methods to prove that the log factor for the folk theorem can be removed with cooperation possible if the channel capacity-discount rate ratio grows toward infinity?
