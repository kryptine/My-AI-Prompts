1. Robust Mechanisms for the Financing of Public Goods https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/brooksdu_publicgoods.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4482541
2. On the Structure of Informationally Robust Optimal Mechanisms
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA20240
3. Dual Reductions and the First-Order Approach for Informationally Robust Mechanism Design https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~sodu/brooksdu_dual.pdf
Requests:
1. Can you please write full mathematical specifications and expand the natural-language proofs until they are suitable for formalization in theorem provers, with particular focus on the application to public goods, but making everything as general as the papers?
2. Can you implement these in C# and prove their correctness in TLA+ and Dafny?
