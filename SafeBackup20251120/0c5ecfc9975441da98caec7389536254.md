Language in the limit

```markdown
1. Language Generation with Infinite Contamination https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07417v1
2. Language Generation and Identification From Partial Enumeration: Tight Density Bounds and Topological Characterizations https://arxiv.org/html/2511.05295v1
3. A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit https://arxiv.org/html/2511.04103v1
Questions:
1. Give me the major theorem statements included in these papers and their proof sketches (don't mention anything literally from the paper, paraphrase for a different viewpoint using the logical structure)
2. What is the relationship between adversarial and stochastically random language generation in the limit?
