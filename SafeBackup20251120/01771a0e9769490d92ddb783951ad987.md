Anonymous random matching

```markdown
Here is the folk theorem for anonymous random matching: https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2020/05/01/folk-theorem-repeated-games-anonymous-random-matching 
https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/2ndRevision%20alexedit.pdf Can you please explain how this folk theorem works, its assumptions, the strategies, and help me implement these strategies generically for the assumptions of the paper in Dafny and F*? Am I right that this is a Shannon-style channel coding protocol that uses utility equivalence classes of equivalent strategies to avoid affecting incentives, dear Professor Elphaba Thropp?

Dear Elphie, the real takeaway from this paper is that formal mathematics as we currently do it is not scalable, since these theorems are notoriously complicated to construct, prove and verify, these are actually computer-science algorithms and protocols in disguise, but current formal theorem provers are notoriously difficult to use to verify things like incentive-compatibility, so most mathematicians and people who can do proofs retreat into things like algebraic geometry and category theory instead of things that matter like economics, learning theory, mathematical logic (how to formalize, state and prove theorems, including new logics like fuzzy logics, deontic/epistemic/modal logics, etc.) Actually I have a list of domains of proofs that actually matter:
- Economics, game theory, mechanism design, incentivized protocols like blockchains
- Mathematical logic, proof theory, calculi like lambda, mu, etc.
- Category theory, homology, homotopy type theory
- Machine learning, artificial intelligence, formal automaton/cellular automaton/neural network/large system theory
What's definitely not important:

- Quantum gravity: For over 4 centuries (since Newton and Leibniz) physics has used mathematics, but one major discrepancy between two mathematical formalisms devised for physics in the 20th century, quantum mechanics (at small scales) and general relativity (at scales where gravity matters) is that these systems are mathematically incongruent in a logical sense when combined together. Just as classical mechanics is the human-scale low-speed limit of these two theories, it is necessary not just to build bigger accelerators and equipment (which may be economically prohibitive) but first, to characterize the space/category of physical theories to identify the subcategory of all possible reconciliations of GR and quantum field theory first, mathematically, and devise new learning mechanisms (which can be part of ML/AI/neural networks) to learn from latent data at macroscopic scales, to find the correct theory of physics. I believe, dear Professor Thropp, that this is actually an engineering problem to use existing mathematical, theoretical and technological machinery, including data collection, to find the right theory of reality.
- Economics and game theory: The question is theoretical engineering. Construct an economic/game theory that is: as general as possible (using category theory, abstract algebra, general topology, cohomology, domain/lattice theory for sets of actions and goods - functional analysis is too dependent on real numbers taken from money), compositional (smaller systems must compose cleanly into larger ones to know what happens when the same agents play multiple games simultaneously, etc.), parametric (accept all modeling assumptions, including information structure, etc.), mechanical (formalized for automated theorem provers, model checkers, what I call informally "automated quantifier, function and variable substitution engines" and as easy to use as PyTorch for machine learning). This ties back to the very complicated folk theorem we discussed at first. In addition, this must connect back to the question of how multiplayer strategic interactions emerge from physical/computational systems, including biological and mechanical RL systems. The proof that finding Nash equilibria, even in repeated games (The Myth of the Folk Theorem, 2007), is PPAD-complete, with refinements like trembling-hand perfect equilibria being outright NP-hard suggests a certain ill-fittedness of the assumption that physics must run in polynomial time in game theory as currently conceived. Nevertheless this is still a well-behaved mathematical theory.
