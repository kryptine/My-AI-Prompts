1. Robust Predictions in
Infinite-Horizon Games—an
Unrefinable Folk Theorem
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/53d0/49e5963c14246e541f6914b7146f8ea6b76a.pdf
2. Degree-K subgame perfect Nash equilibria and the folk theorem https://www.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dp/papers/e-20-001.pdf
Can you please explain what these papers say and which parts of the papers talk about coalition-proof subgame-perfect Nash equilibria in repeated games? Can you explain them to me in more detail?
