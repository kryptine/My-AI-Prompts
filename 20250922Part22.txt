Write Part 22 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the game-theoretic structure of the three papers, which are all zero-sum, and by unifying the formalisms of the papers by writing full Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations, with directory trees, by defining information theory, algorithmic information theory, the "Ressayre
axioms" of exponential fields with an exponential operation and a logarithm operation with unknown but fixed base for log-likelihoods and other logarithmic constructions with homomorphism laws and the axiom that exp and log are group homomorphisms between (RCF_W_IF, +) and (RCF_W_IF>0, x), or weaker variants of these axioms if sufficient to define, use and prove theorems about common machine-learning concepts and quantities like Rademacher complexity and provably approximately correct (PAC) learning bounds as well as gradient descent, and please unify the formalisms of all the papers with the following hints: Papers 1 and 2 both use PAC-Bayes learning bounds, papers 4 and 2 are both theoretical motivations of hallucination which can be connected by the classic unification between utility maximization and description length minimization, and paper 3 can be combined with the rest by analyzing the gradient descent step in terms of standard machine learning analyses. In addition, please also state, formalize and prove theorems about the fundamental trade-off in AI alignment between preventing harmful uses (externally-directed harm) and intent divergence (self-directed harm) in the formalisms of machine learning, with full formula manipulation steps, premises, set-ups in terms of three components (model creator and operator, user, the model itself), with RLHF setting the utility function. Please write the text section after the formalizations and also try to explain the theorems' formal expressions and proofs in summary form with the important steps crucial to the argument preserved and elaborated.
1. The Alignment Bottleneck: https://arxiv.org/html/2509.15932v1
2. Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models https://arxiv.org/html/2507.22915v1
3. Subliminal Learning: Language models transmit behavioral traits via hidden signals in data https://arxiv.org/html/2507.14805v1
4. Predictable Compression Failures: Why Language Models Actually Hallucinate https://arxiv.org/html/2509.11208v1
Please make the new theorems about the alignment tradeoff as rigorous as these papers, lengthening thinking time if needed to make full theorems with formal proofs in terms of mathematics in PAC-Bayes bounds, Rademacher complexity and gradient descent separately.
