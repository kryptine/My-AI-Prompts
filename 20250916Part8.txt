Formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial demonstrative version, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it.
Part 8 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and its generalization as described in the paper "Substructural fixed-point theorems and the diagonal argument: theme and variations" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00239v2 whose summary is at https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/Diagonal.tex:

2. Why language models hallucinate https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04664v1

These three theorems all show that AI cannot be mechanistically interpreted by humans, and only formalist interpretations of their behavior is possible. This also applies to any algorithmic system, including human organizations, governments and other systems made up of multiple humans, machines and micro-behaviors, therefore only machines can temper machines, according to Ashby & Conant's law of requisite variety/good regulator theorem, which is also isomorphic to these theorems above in terms of independent variables.
