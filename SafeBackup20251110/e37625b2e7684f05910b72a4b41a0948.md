   Here is a proof of Payor's lemma that `Provable(Must(Must(X)->X))->X` implies `Provable(X)` in modal logic: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem so can you formalize the main article and the comments' ideas in Coq, Agda, and Lean? In addition, can you please give an outline to solve https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrpnEDpLPxsmmsLzs/open-technical-problem-a-quinean-proof-of-loeb-s-theorem-for by allowing modal provability logic to refer to proofs using formulas within the theory as Necessary(Proof->Necessary(Statement)) and try to extend this to full Agda, Coq and Lean proofs is possible, and formalize the strategies within the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07006 as well as try to fix So8res' comment about the link between Loeb's theorem and the Y-combinator by the following separate methods: by `eval`ing forms instead of `quote`ing functions, by boxing according to the blog post https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2016/05/lobs-theorem-is-almost-y-combinator.html and by analogy to the implementation of the Y-combinator in Haskell that respects the type system by using a `newtype` but which doesn't compile in GHC, and give other theorems similar to Lob's theorem but based on other fixed-point combinators such as Turing's theta combinator? In addition, can you please use the Curry-Loeb paradox to prove Loeb's theorem by using the modal fixed point and substituting it into the paradox statement, showing that Loeb's theorem follows from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as described in http://tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/15/tr15abs.html for me?
