Infra-Bayesian

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about infra-Bayesianism and Garrabrant induction
   1. Regret bounds https://arxiv.org/html/2504.06820v2
   2. Betting on what is neither verifiable nor falsifiable https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14021v1
   3. An automated synthesis framework https://arxiv.org/html/2506.15787v4
   According to the first paper it is a linking of logical induction and infra-Bayesianism for non-logically omniscient agents, so can you please start formalizing the main contents, ideas, and proofs of the three papers in Agda, Coq and Lean4, exactly as written, as a starting point for automated theorem proving? That is, you do not have to complete everything in one go, just do it as far as possible, and if it is too long I will continue streaming the thread like an `IEnumerator` in C# or an `Iterator` in Python until the entire formalization is complete. Do it as far as possible, with `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders for what you can't, in fact if it's intuitive and omitted in the papers placeholders should be used so that formal proof searches will fill the gap. Can you give me ideas of proving the equivalence of infra-Bayesianism, Garrabrant logical induction and the second paper's framework using Kraft's inequality and Eudoxus reals by providing formalizations of these intuitions as far as possible?
