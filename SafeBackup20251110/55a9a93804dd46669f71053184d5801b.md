Natural latents

1. ```markdown
   Here are LessWrong posts about natural latents, a new way to view Bayesian inference:
   1. https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Gd36HT7qLr684SYuQ/stochastic-natural-latent-implies-deterministic-natural
   2. https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dWQWzGCSFj6GTZHz7/natural-latents-the-math
   3. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mMEbfooQzMwJERAJJ/natural-latents-the-concepts
   Can you please use the standard libraries for measure theory, real analysis and linear algebra, define probability theory, to translate these concepts into Agda, Coq and Lean4, and further attempt to prove the fundamental theorem of the theory of natural latents, the fact that stochastic natural latents imply deterministic natural latents within the same context, using arguments different from article 1 listed above, once by using the theory of Arrow-Debreu markets with prices on stochastic contingencies, once by using the theory of exponential Harsanyi type spaces with the stochasticity being a separate player, and once using the theory of Markov and copy-delete categories?
