Square-root space

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about tree-height compression at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.14831v1 so can you implement the algorithms for conversion of algorithms from time to square-root space in Agda, Lean and Dafny, and state the theorems about equivalence and speedup from time to square root of space according to the paper, and help me develop these into full formalizations?
