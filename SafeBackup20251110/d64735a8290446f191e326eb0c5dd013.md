   Here are two papers about the injectivity and surjectivity properties of neural networks:
   1. Complexity of Injectivity and Verification of ReLU Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19805v3
   2. On Surjectivity of Neural Networks: Can you elicit any behavior from your model? https://arxiv.org/html/2508.19445v1
   Can you please make translations of the definitions, propositions and proofs of these papers into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 that are as long as necessary to reproduce all the main points within the paper to allow further development, using standard libraries for real numbers, linear algebra, measure theory (almost all) and function theory (injectivity, surjectivity), while defining ReLU, MLP and other neural network primitives such as attention explicitly, using placeholders such as `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it or the points are omitted by the papers, but using natural-language comments only when there is nothing else to say within the formal syntax, otherwise always using formal syntax with partial proofs over natural language with `admit` or `sorry`, and can you attempt to fill in the missing proofs in https://arxiv.org/html/2508.17821v1 using the ideas from the papers above by first formalizing the last paper in Agda, Rocq and Lean4 too?
