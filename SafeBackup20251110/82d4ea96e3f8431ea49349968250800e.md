Quantum Bayes

1. ```markdown
   Here is an arXiv paper about the Quantum Bayes' rule https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00319v3 and the LessWrong summary https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qjRYvGcZrrdqyzoRY/a-quantum-equivalent-to-bayes-rule so can you please translate the minimum change principle into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 using standard libraries for linear algebra, probability theory, functional analysis, and real numbers and make the answers as long as necessary to reproduce all the intuitive points and ideas within the demonstrations, with `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders for gaps within the original, for me to begin full formalization and automated searches for a full formal proof, and can you tell me whether the summary was written by AI?
