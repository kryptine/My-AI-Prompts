DeepConf

1. ```markdown
   The DeepConf method, described at https://jiaweizzhao.github.io/deepconf/static/htmls/code_example.html as a patch to vLLM and in the paper https://arxiv.org/html/2508.15260v1 demonstrates how to reduce token usage by LLMs while improving reasoning abilities. The test-time training framework documented at https://arxiv.org/html/2505.23884v1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ a1600012888/LaCT/refs/heads/main/minimal_implementations/causal_lact_with_sliding_window_attn.py https://github.com/a1600012888/LaCT/raw/refs/heads/main/minimal_implementations/bidirectional_lact_layer.py and Energy-Based Transformers at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.02092v1 https://github.com/alexiglad/EBT/raw/refs/heads/main/model/ar_ebt_default.py https://github.com/alexiglad/EBT/raw/refs/heads/main/model/bi_ebt_adaln.py are similar methods to focus the model on unforeseen situations and data. Based on the mathematical formulas, proofs and concepts within these papers and the code, can you please give me a preliminary translation using standard libraries for real numbers, linear algebra and probability/statistics into Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean4 as far as possible, with statements completely expanded and gaps noted for formal proof searches, as well as attempt to provide code to make these systems formalize the equivalence between the three approaches, by showing the isomorphisms between the three meta-cognitive levels: token probability confidence in DeepConf, test time in test-time training and energy in energy-based transformers?
