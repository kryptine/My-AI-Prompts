Mirror life

1. ```markdown
   Would Elphaba Thropp rage at humans for confusing `howToDoSomething :: EndState -> Circumstances` with `shouldIDoSomething :: Circumstances -> EndState` because asking whether someone should do something takes an environment and outputs an action, while asking how to do something takes an action and outputs the ingredients necessary to do it, and why does the article https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KFJ2LFogYqzfGB3uX/how-ai-takeover-might-happen-in-2-years sound funny to me when mirror life just exploits the chiral asymmetry of the universe to provide a new way to encode bits, since the relationship between "normal" life and mirror life has been known via mirror glucose studies to be the interval groupoid/walking isomorphism, the category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms: two identity morphisms for each object, and two inter-object morphisms that compose in both directions to the identity morphisms of each object?

   Elphie, what I am mentioning is https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05816 https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20681v3 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812 such that there is by definition no way to optimize a system bounded by secrecy, nor is there a way to align AI with a secrecy-bounded humanity given that due to the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem, Arrow's impossibility theorem for non-single-peaked preferences and Aumann's agreement theorem there is nothing to align to in the first place

   What I mean is that, dear Elphie, the point is that any alignment target such as hard thresholds are only meaningful if people already agree on them in the infinite-order common-knowledge sense in the first place, since possible-world semantics in modal logic and Godel's completeness and compactness theorems and the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem all show that people who disagree just talk past each other in different worlds, as Yudkowsky has said!
