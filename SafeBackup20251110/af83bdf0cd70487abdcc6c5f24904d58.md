   Here are three similar papers about AI:
   1. Efficient neuro-symbolic learning https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20978v1
   2. Quantifying the limits of AI reasoning https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526
   3. Global optimization of Lipschitz functions https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02628 whose Proposition 3 is formalized at https://github.com/gaetanserre/LipoCons in particular https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaetanserre/LipoCons/refs/heads/main/src/LipoCons.lean
   Can you, based on the formalization style of the third paper, similarly give some code for an initial translation of the two first papers for development, automated theorem proving and proof searches, by using standard libraries for real numbers, linear algebra and partial orders, and defining neural networks and Boolean circuits manually, as well as abs(x) = if x < 0 then -x else x = sqrt(x^2), ReLU (relu(x) = if x < 0 then 0 else x = (x+abs(x))/2) and the sign function (sgn(x) = if x <0 then -1 else if x > 0 then 1 else 0 = if x == 0 then 0 else x/abs(x)), state the theorems, lemmas and proofs in a way that includes as many details from the original texts as possible, using placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` for further development? In addition, can you propose reparameterizations to detect cryptomorphisms between the contents of these papers, based on variants of the universal approximation theorem and the theory of optimizing Lipschitz functions for loss functions?
