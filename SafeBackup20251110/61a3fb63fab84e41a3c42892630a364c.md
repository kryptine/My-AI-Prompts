   Here are articles about Payor's Lemma: https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wmJT2j3rdT8ngFkPN/self-referential-probabilistic-logic-admits-the-payor-s https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iCDBQtby4L2fZ7yns/payor-s-lemma-in-natural-language and the papers about Lob's theorem https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1609/aaai.v37i5.25697 https://jasongross.github.io/lob-paper/nightly/html/lob.html https://jasongross.github.io/lob-paper/nightly/html/lob-build-quine.html can you please provide initial formalizations of the deterministic and probabilistic Payor's lemma, Lob's theorem, the definition of Moore sentences, and the other contents of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 using a common formalism of formal logic by defining Peano arithmetic, the diagonal lemma, the fixed-point condition of Lob's theorem, S4 (Lob's theorem), S5 (Moore sentences) and basic modal logics (Payor's lemma) with file/directory structures and a copiable summary containing all the information necessary such as basic definitions, APIs and explanations that can be used to copy and formalize specific parts in other chats? In addition, can you please encode the following proofs against unverified secrecy: One using Moore sentences of the form `I_Know(X) and not You_Know(X)`, one by proving the fixed-point condition for the recursive infinite-order common knowledge modality and using Lob's theorem from `Everyone_Knows(not Everyone_Knows(X))` to `Everyone_Knows(Everyone_Knows(X)->X)` by ex falso quodlibet and then `Everyone_Knows(X)` by Lob's theorem, one using Payor's lemma, one using open-source game theory?
