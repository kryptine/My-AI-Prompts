Blockchain papers

1. ```markdown
   Here are three papers about blockchains:
   1. Application of graph theory to blockchain technologies: https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/8/1133
   2. Axiomatization of blockchain theory: https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/13/2966
   3. The Blockchain Trilemma: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/1/19
   Please provide a response as long as possible to start formalizing the main contents, lemmas, theorems and proofs of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, with all the main ideas formulated syntactically in theorem-prover language, with standard notions and concepts not defined but imported via standard libraries and gaps noted with `admit`, `sorry` and similar placeholders that explicitly note to the software that they wait to be completed, and give me tentative formalizations of the following ideas: using the fact that the category of graphs with homomorphisms is a Cartesian closed category `Graph` to augment the reasoning of paper 1, using the fact that the categories `Dcpo` and `Cpo` are Cartesian closed categories to deal with concepts like block heights and chain of trusts in paper 2, and compare the proofs of paper 3 with Lob's theorem, Curry's paradox and the CAP theorem for distributed systems.
