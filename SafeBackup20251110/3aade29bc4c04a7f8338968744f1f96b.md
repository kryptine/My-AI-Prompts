   After the paper "A Malliavin-Stein experiment" at https://arxiv.org/html/2509.03065v1 here is the paper "On the theoretical limitations of embedding-based retrieval": https://arxiv.org/html/2508.21038v1 (code is available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-deepmind/limit/refs/heads/main/code/generate_limit_dataset.ipynb that shows exactly how the rank-manipulation operations are performed), the paper "Why language models hallucinate" at https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04664v1 and "Calibrated language models must hallucinate" at https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14648v3 can you please start my project of formalizing only the definitions, propositions, lemmas, theorems and proofs of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 by providing directory/file trees and other context such as APIs, ideas and definitions in a separate code box at the beginning that is concise while detailed enough to be copied into every later chat for formalization of each part of file, and by drafting each file with the ideas, definitions and proof sketches that should incorporate as many formal details, steps and formulas from the papers as possible, with gaps shown using `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders, with natural-language comments and identifiers only for the non-formalizable parts, the rest following as much formal structure and basic concepts as possible, keeping imports only for the most fundamental concepts in real analysis and linear algebra, with the rest spelled out, while keeping within the context window and making the global summary at 26k tokens maximum to fit within the 128k context window of each part, where each directory will have its own context?
