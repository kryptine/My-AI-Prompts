   Here is a website about three potential outcomes for AI development: https://doctrines.ai/
   1. Given the existence of mechanisms for public goods such as RetroPGF (documented and analysed at < https://arxiv.org/html/2505.16068v1 > and < https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16285v1 >), quadratic funding/voting, Harberger taxes, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves dominant-strategy mechanisms, and open-source program equilibria, in which defect-until-proof-of-cooperation sometimes works better than cooperate-until-proof-of-defection because proofs of defection can recursively reference each other's strategies and apply Lob's theorem and Curry's paradox, where is the fourth possibility: AI permanently transforms human civilization, abolishing things like nation-states while ensuring better global cooperation?
   2. Cryptography (universal one-way functions and one-way hash functions, which can be constructed independently of the specific knowledge of any particular one-way functions, one-time pads, Shamir's secret sharing and other information-theoretically secure or provably computationally optimally secure cryptosystems), Garrabrant's logical induction, and infra-Bayesianism in the non-realizable settings are model-independent and proven to be secure against modestly computationally more powerful adversaries; in addition, Godel's logical, Blum's computable and linear speed-up theorems, Levin's universal search and Hutter's AIXI (once the Solomonoff prior is parameterized as computable, if the induction ranges over all computable functions then AIXI is uncomputable and RE-hard) all share the same structure of infinite loops of recursive improvement in compute capability, which are natural constructions; therefore the dominance doctrine is suspect when existing chat-level LLMs, not to mention reasoning ones, can be plugged into automated theorem provers (Lean, Rocq, Agda), logic satisfiability solvers (Z3, CVC5), chess engines, expert systems (CLIPS), model checkers (TLA+) as well as all existing simulation frameworks (MATLAB, SWMM, HPC).
   3. What about using Lob's theorem and Curry's paradox to show that if it is known that `Know(not Safe -> not Know(Safe))` then it is known than `Known(Safe)` due to a contrapositive rephrasing of the premise of Lob's theorem, that is, once we believe that AI can kill us, we have no way of knowing whether we are dead due to AI deception, in addition, due to unconventional computing frameworks and the definition of consciousness as a functor, as well as the definition of algorithms as cellular automata in Fredkin's reversible computing model at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.06035v1 it may well be impossible for us to notice any change when we are killed simultaneously, right?
