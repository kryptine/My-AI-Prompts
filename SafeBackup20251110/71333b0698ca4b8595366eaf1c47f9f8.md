   Explain Schrodinger's cat in terms of fundamental mathematics (not contingent physics), as well as the Reeh-Schlieder theorem in Hilbert spaces, also in a literary way in two separate ways using two separate literary references: the Cheshire Cat in *Alice: Through The Looking Glass* by Lewis Carroll, and the state of Fiyero from the viewpoint of Elphaba in *Wicked* during the number *No Good Deed* (the following explanations are requested: in terms of density functions over Hilbert spaces, in terms of the yanking lemma in dagger-compact monoidal categories, in terms of *Alice* by Carroll and in terms of *Wicked* by Maguire and Schwartz)
