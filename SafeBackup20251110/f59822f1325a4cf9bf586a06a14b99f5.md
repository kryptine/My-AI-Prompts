   Can you, using the standard libraries for real numbers, real analysis, probability theory, information theory and linear algebra, translate the contents of these posts into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean so as to preserve the intuitive meaning of these posts, in the form of formal machine-readable notation that correctly reflects the spirits of the theorems and the proofs, with placeholders like `sorry` and `admit` for skipped steps, since my intent is automated gap-filling and proof searches for complete proofs, and in addition, tell me how infra-Bayesianism concepts line up with the good regulator theorem by the action sets on the world lining up with the control knobs of the regulator, with the Myhill isomorphism theorem demonstrated at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.05028v1 to show how alignment along a subset can be extended to a bijection for the entire set, as well as the Weihrauch lattice at https://arxiv.org/html/2408.14999v4 showing how undecidable certain formulations of computational alignment are?
