Reservoir

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers on reservoir, photonic and neuromorphic computing:
   1. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09430-z
   2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58349-6
   3. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52259-9
   Can you please show me the major mathematical formalisms, formulas, theorems and proofs of these papers by making your answer in Agda, Lean4 and Coq by creating a directory structure for reservoir, neuromorphic and optical computing, importing libraries for linear algebra, real numbers while defining the rest in terms of functions and matrices, and stating and giving proof sketches of universal approximation theorems and convergence theorems, so that I have a place to start developing the formalization in LLMs, with a context header that can be copy-pasted into other chats so that this answer and subsequent threads fit in the context window, which includes things like API definitions and imports at a precise enough level for independent development and coherence?
