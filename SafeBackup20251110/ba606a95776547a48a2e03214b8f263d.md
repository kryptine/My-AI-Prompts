Finite factored set theory

1. ```markdown
   Here is an introduction to the theory of finite factored sets: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N5Jm6Nj4HkNKySA5Z/finite-factored-sets and here is the theory of factored space models: https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02579v2 so can you please formalize the fundamental theorem https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DrchMHizfPtW3nJh2/the-fundamental-theorem-for-measurable-factor-spaces based on https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EKPSgN8LsiEJzX5ni/a-well-defined-history-in-measurable-factor-spaces and the main definitions, theorems and proofs of the documents I refer to in Agda, Coq and Lean4, using the most literal and spirit-preserving translation of the technical contents into these languages' syntax and semantics as possible, for example by using standard libraries for pre-defined concepts, such as real numbers, graph theory, and Cartesian products, defining only the new concepts shown within these papers, and fill in any incompleteness with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` but not natural-language comments, which should always be replaced with formalized syntax as far as possible, using mechanisms like typed holes for gaps, as a starting point for machine formalization and theorem proving, and make the formalized responses to this first prompt as long as possible, so as to allow me to work on them offline?

   By the way, "as long 
   as possible" means that you should be reflect the contents of the paper faithfully, without extrapolations, and do not abridge anything.
