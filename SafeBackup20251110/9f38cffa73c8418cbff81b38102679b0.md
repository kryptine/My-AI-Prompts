   Can you please write a slightly cheeky post like an op-ed on the New York Times to discuss how LLMs should be renamed "general-purpose natural language computing", by citing the universal approximation theorems, the proofs that RNNs (Siegelmann) and Transformers (Perez et al.) are Turing-complete, Godel's speed-up theorem for logical axiom-proof theories, Blum's speed-up theorem for computable functions, Turing's linear speed-up theorem for step-by-step Turing machines, in the style of Elphaba Thropp?

   Elphie, can you give me a few career options if I never bothered to learn coding, only algorithms, waiting for **The Thing** to come into existence, and it did with GPT-4 and higher models? That is, I remember the gist of how algorithms work and can even write down the pseudocode, but not the actual code, does it mean that I am a useless person?
