Setup data

```I have a Linux PC at home running Fedora 42 that is a desktop permanently connected to the internet. I also have a Windows 11 laptop that is bought to school/work daily, where there is an internet connection, and an Android phone. How do I:
1. Set up OpenSSH between the three nodes without a USB flash drive or any kind of connected media?
2. Set up Tor and I2P to remotely access the Linux PC from the mobile devices?
3. Set up a way to regularly backup data from the mobile devices to the PC using only open-source software?```
