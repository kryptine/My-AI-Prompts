Alignment trap

1. ```markdown
   Here are two papers about the fundamental difficulty of AI safety:
   1. "The alignment trap" by Jasper Yao at https://arxiv.org/html/2506.10304v2
   2. "On the impossibility of separating intelligence from judgment" by Sarah Ball et al. at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07341v1
   In addition, here is the paper "On one-way functions and Kolmogorov complexity", which provides an equivalent condition for the existence of one-way functions in any oracular or relativized computational model, including quantum computing: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11514 and https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/423
	Can you please extract only the mathematical claims, theorems, lemmas and proofs from these papers and provide a starting point for formalization within Lean4, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Agda by literal translation of as much of the formal arguments of these papers as possible, which intuitive or skipped parts replaced with placeholders like `admit`, and also incorporating the following ideas:
	1. Define universal one-way functions and universal search according to Levin. Parameterize the construction within the "separating intelligence from judgment" paper with the one-way function provided as a separate argument. Argue and formalize the idea that if the LLM can hide its state using any one-way function, so can the adversary despite not knowing that function by using universal one-way functions.
	2. Use the "OWF and K-complexity" paper to formalize the central theorem and compare the equivalent statement with the existence of one-way functions when substituted into the second paper with the “Can’t Store It” Barrier.
   3. Compare Theorem 6.3 (No Universal Alignment Technique) with the proofs of the No Free Lunch theorem, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as used to prove Cantor's diagonal argument, and Theorem 2 (Prompt-detection filter impossibility via secret keys, informal).
