Hallucinations and subliminal learning

1. ```markdown
   Here is an OpenAI paper on hallucinations: https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/
   a paper about mistake-bounded online learning: https://arxiv.org/html/2509.03892v1 and a paper about subliminal learning: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.14805v1
   Can you please help me formalize these in Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean by proposing file/directory tree structures with each file elaborated with standard-library import and containing as much of the definitions, theorems and proofs as possible within the context window limit of a single response, with enough modularity for each directory or topic, as well as a header I can copy into independent chats to have the LLM elaborate that part of the system coherently according to the surrounding definitions, theorems and proofs so that the responses can be copied back into the project, and use these following guides and hints for conceptual organization and category-theoretic unification: hallucinations, subliminal learning and the learning bounds are inevitable because the theory (the language model, the gradient descent step and the compute bounds) cannot accomodate the data (the training data, the language model and the function respectively) due to Chaitin's incompleteness theorem, Tarski's undefinability theorem, Godel's second incompleteness theorem, the uncomputability of AIXI when the Solomonoff induction ranges over all computable functions (Leike & Hutter 2015) and Rice's theorem?
