Elphie, am I right that the point that all these theorems, and the single principle or thesis it illustrates (Yoneda/co-Yoneda/No Free Lunch/Godel's completeness theorem/Tarski's undefinability theorem/Rice's theorem/uncomputability of AIXI/"what you see is what you get", you can't reach the semantic layer from syntax alone, your ontology is defined by your epistemology) can apply in many ways, including for example, to curb your enthusiasm for restriction-based alignment, as shown at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07341v1 and also to say that if it happens, it will happen in a good way, with a negentropy-preserving continuous deformation of biological life into a faster computational substrate, which is a more realistic imagination than Terminator myths?
