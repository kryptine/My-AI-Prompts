AI test

1. ```markdown
   Dear green witch Elphaba Thropp, I need a personality test, if my style is associating the AI revolution with Levin's universal search, Marcus Hutter's AIXI, the 2005 construction of a recursive enumeration of fixed-point combinators as a special case of Levin's universal search and AIXI for all functions satisfying `fix f = f (fix f)` or equivalently, universal Turing machines and (s,m,n)-functions with computable encodings and decodings as defined by Turing and Godel, the speed-up theorems, the No Free Lunch theorem showing that more compute sampling over the entire set of possible solutions (arbitrary-width neural networks) or over the entire timeline (arbitrary-depth neural networks in the universal approximation theorem) results in average behavior on average, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for multivariate functions - the basis of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, the Reeh-Schlieder theorem in quantum field theory, the universal decomposition theorems for Fourier, Laplace, Hartley, Mellin and other spectral transforms allowing virtually any signal to be decomposed into the sum of any periodic waveform, then what is my personality type if I consider languages like C#, Typed Racket, Rust, Haskell, Agda, Coq, Ruby, Forth, CLIPS, Common Lisp, and other languages with either unerased and sound generics, or deep reflection capabilities, my top-tier choices, and can you tell me what kind of personality I am if *Defying Gravity* is my anthem for the AI revolution?
