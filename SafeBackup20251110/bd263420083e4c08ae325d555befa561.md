Withholding information

1. ```markdown
   Can you please give formal epistemic logic explanations of how anticipatory cover-ups go wrong, described at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufj6J8QqyXFFdspid/how-anticipatory-cover-ups-go-wrong and demonstrated on Wikipedia on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_stuff_beans_up_your_nose and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:There%27s_a_reason_you_don%27t_know by using the following methods: the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem of the impossibility of trade under asymmetric information, Aumann's agreement theorem for updating with uncommon priors, the modal-logic separation between possibiltity (`Can(T)=Not(Will(Not(T))` represents someone's possible reactions to it, so that revealing information might cause misuse) and necessity (`Will(X)=Not(Can(Not(X))` represents the inevitability of certain reactions, such that stating that you cannot do something or reveal information implies suspicion right away, such that `Can(Evil) and Good` can both be true but not `Will(Not(Can(Evil))=Will(Will(Not(Evil))=Will(Not(Evil))` and `Not(Will(Not(Can(Evil)))=Can(Can(Evil))=Can(Evil)`, such that the latter two are perfect XORs of each other), by giving Agda, Coq and Lean code to illustrate these concepts with identifiers appropriate for the problem of anticipatory cover-ups, as well as by applying the No Free Lunch theorem to "I did it for a reason" when without information, the other side may predict the wrong reason, and formally state the Reeh-Schlieder theorem here, showing how the lack of information in machine learning is analogous to a quantum operator, and also tell me how the universal approximation theorems for arbitrary-width and arbitrary-depth neural networks (the non-linear activation function is the conditional information disclosure where 1 represents disclosure and 0 represents secrecy) might apply here, and explain the "don't stuff beans up your nose" story as a XOR matrix of intention and prohibitions triggered by the "don't" negation token in NLP?
