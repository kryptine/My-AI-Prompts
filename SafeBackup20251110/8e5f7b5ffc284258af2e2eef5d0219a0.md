Transcendence

1. ```markdown
   Can you please tell me how language models outperform experts that train them according to the papers https://arxiv.org/html/2406.11741v4 and https://arxiv.org/html/2508.17669v1 by translating the mathematical statements, definitions, and propositions of these papers into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 for further experimentation with theorem-proving and reasoning?
