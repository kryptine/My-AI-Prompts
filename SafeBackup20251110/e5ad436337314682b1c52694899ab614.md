Fixed points

1. ```markdown
   Here are two articles by Mayer Goldberg:
   1. On the recursive enumerability of fixed-point combinators at https://www.brics.dk/RS/05/1/
   2. A Variadic Extension of Curry's Fixed-Point Combinator at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10990-005-4881-8 and https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s10990-005-4881-8 
   Please attempt to translate Goldberg's constructions and proofs into Agda, Lean4 and Rocq (formerly Coq), as well as Oleg Kiselyov's combinators and proofs of these facts on https://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/fixed-point-combinators.html and in addition, please also use Kiselyov's approach of enumerating lambda/combinatory terms in a Levin's universal search/Hutter's AIXI style loop and reducing them successively until either the fixed-point equation `fix f = f (fix f)` is definitely confirmed or refuted for generic variable arguments, to translate Goldberg's papers into Kiselyov's concepts in Agda, Rocq and Lean4.
