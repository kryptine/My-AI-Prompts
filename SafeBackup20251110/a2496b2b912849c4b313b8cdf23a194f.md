White noise and subliminal learning

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about AI misalignment and fraud:
   1. Subliminal learning: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.14805v1
   2. Fraudulent white noise: https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013170
   3. Quantifying misalignment: https://arxiv.org/html/2406.04231v4
   Based on the content of these papers, can you please restate the major points of the theorems, proofs and formulas within these papers by literal translation into Agda, Coq and Lean4 using standard libraries for pre-defined concepts such as real numbers and linear algebra, with the gaps shown explicitly in the code with `admit`, `sorry`, typed holes and other semantic placeholders, in a way that makes the formal syntax of the code match exactly the intent and intuitions behind the statements, theorems and proofs, that is, a "literal formalization" that demonstrates how formal systems are isomorphic to natural-language mathematical proofs, and in addition, attempt to flesh out formally the isomorphisms between the different statements of misalignment/conflict in terms of agents/AI models/transmitters and subliminal signals/white noise/coordination patterns, and consult the source code of the misalignment model at https://github.com/RIET-lab/quantifying-misalignment/raw/refs/heads/main/src/multiagent_misalignment_model.py as reference for conversion and formalization?
