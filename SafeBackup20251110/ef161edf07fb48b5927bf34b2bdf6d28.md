World models

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about the world models implicit in any AI agent:
   1. Evaluating the implicit world model https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03689v3
   2. General agents contain world models https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622
   3. Robust agents learn causal world models https://arxiv.org/html/2402.10877v7 summarized at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Rwjrrmn6LBzHrfen7/an-illustrated-summary-of-robust-agents-learn-causal-world
   Can you please give me a full plan for formalizing these theorems, in addition to Ashby & Conant's good regulator theorem, in Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean4, with tree structures for files, definitions, theorems, proofs, as much code as necessary for the machines to parse and understand the main contents, definitions, and proofs of the papers, with placeholders for unfinished parts, and a conceptual unification using the comonadic or continuation-monad framing, within the context window, assuming that I will copy-paste the response into other chats and maybe other AI systems, by providing a full header that I can copy-paste into requests or prompts for each part separately listing all the APIs and other information for coherence, by analogy to the Transformer, where I am evaluating a meta-Transformer where the Query, Key and Value have scalars that are extended strings and responses?
