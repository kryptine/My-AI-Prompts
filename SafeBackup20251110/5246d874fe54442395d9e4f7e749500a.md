Collaboration

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about human-AI collaboration:
   1. Collaborating with GenAI at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20213v1
   2. A dynamic approach to collaborative document writing at https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17489 https://github.com/AvitalFinanaser/Dynamic-CDW.git https://github.com/AvitalFinanaser/Dynamic-CDW/raw/refs/heads/main/simulation/cdw_system.py https://github.com/AvitalFinanaser/Dynamic-CDW/raw/refs/heads/main/simulation/scheduler.py https://github.com/AvitalFinanaser/Dynamic-CDW/raw/refs/heads/main/simulation/solution_analysis.py
   Please give literal translations of the mathematical and programmatic contents (procedures, theorems, proofs) of these papers into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 for automated theorem proving with gaps noted using `admit`, `sorry` and other similar semantic placeholders, since the intent is program synthesis and automated theorem proving with tools like SMT solvers, but with all the formal details and intuitions transliterated into these languages' syntax, semantics and libraries, and in addition, please also formalize these ideas as-is for further development.
