Poison once

1. ```markdown
   An information-theoretic paper about data poisoning for exploiting alignment is published as "Poison Once, Refuse Forever": https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20333 and a paper about theoretical limits of embedding-based retrieval is published at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.21038v1 which shows the limitations of any embedding-based explainability of AI systems, category-theoretically formalized at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20701v1 so can you please use standard libraries for Coq, Agda and Lean4 for standard concepts such as real numbers, linear algebra and category theory, defining information theory, exponentials and logarithms, and other needed concepts within the paper explicitly within the code, to formalize as far as possible the ideas, propositions, proof sketches and proofs of these papers, using placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` for existing gaps within the papers in a way that is parseable and allows for automated development with machine-based proof searches using tactics and solvers, by making the translation from natural language and standard mathematics to Agda, Coq and Lean4 as literal as possible and faithful in form, such that you can reduce the comments if and only if you can replace them with formal syntax? In addition, can you generate formalizations for me to begin investigating the isomorphisms between the contents of these papers to prove the results of one paper using another's formalisms, such as identifying Lemma A.1/2.6 of the category-theoretic paper with the main theorem of the "refuse forever" paper and the rank inequalities of the retrieval paper, under reparameterizations and reframings such as identifying topic relevance in the retrieval paper as harmfulness/harmlessness in the refusal paper?
