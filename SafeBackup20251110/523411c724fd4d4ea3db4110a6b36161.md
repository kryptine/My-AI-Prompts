Interpretability

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about AI interpretability https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00545v1 and its accompanying code https://github.com/pyc-team/pytorch_concepts/raw/refs/heads/master/torch_concepts/base.py https://github.com/pyc-team/pytorch_concepts/raw/refs/heads/master/torch_concepts/nn/bottleneck.py https://github.com/pyc-team/pytorch_concepts/raw/refs/heads/master/torch_concepts/nn/functional.py https://github.com/pyc-team/pytorch_concepts/raw/refs/heads/master/torch_concepts/nn/__init__.py so can you please translate the concepts, formulas, and code into Agda, Lean4, and Rocq (Coq), using only the standard libraries in each language for core concepts like real numbers and vector spaces, defining anything not present, in addition also comparing the definitions and theorems within that paper with the paper about the uncertainty principle of neural networks at https://arxiv.org/html/2205.01493v4 to show that interpretability requires a basis?
