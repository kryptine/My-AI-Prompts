Deep Think

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "Deep Think with Confidence": https://arxiv.org/html/2508.15260 and here is the paper "Test-Time Training": https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13231 can you please give me literal translations of the core formalisms, formulas, and theorems of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, in addition by generalizing the voting system in "Deep Think With Confidence" with a general Pareto-optimal social choice function, taking into account Arrow's impossibility theorem, and also generalizing the combined loss in "Test-Time Training" with any monotonic function instead of just bare addition on both values?
