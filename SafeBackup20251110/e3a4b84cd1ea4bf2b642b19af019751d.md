Quantum

1. ```markdown
   Here are three papers about formulations of quantum mechanics:
   1. On the Equivalence Between the Schrodinger Equation in Quantum Mechanics and the Euler-Bernoulli Equation in Elasticity Theory https://arxiv.org/html/2411.03261v1
   2. Quantum vs. Symplectic Computers https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12755v1
   3. Real Quantum Mechanics in a Kahler Space https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16838v1
   Can you please give me a directory/file tree for Coq, Agda and Lean4 formalizations of these theorems, based on the formulations of Kahler spaces and other real functional linear spaces in which these formulations take place, by importing only real numbers and linear algebra from the standard libraries and defining everything, in which each file comes with at least a skeleton and placeholders with `admit` and `sorry`?
