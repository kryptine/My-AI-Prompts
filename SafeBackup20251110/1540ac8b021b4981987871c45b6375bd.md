Universal approximation

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about the impossibility of safe universal approximators at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.03031v1 and here are papers about the universal approximation theorem at https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13142v1 and https://arxiv.org/html/2505.02288v1 so can you please argue using Whitney's embedding and immersion theorems by taking any smooth function in dimension n, embedding it in dimension 2n and using Whitney's trick by cancelling double-points using a XOR-like mapping in machine learning, thus a diagonalization method `(<*>) f not x = f x (not x);(>>=) point cobord rotate = cobord (rotate point) point` in the `instance Monad ((->) manifold)` to argue that such catastrophic discontinuities, if any, are densely mapped to the higher dimensions, and use similar ideas to fully flesh out the proofs of the impossibility of safety of universal approximators, and the applicability of the UAT to the neural architectures mentioned in the latter two papers, so that you can create a translation to Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 using built-in standard libraries but not external libraries for tactics in theorem provers instead of directly generating entire proofs within LLMs?
