Zero-shot

1. ```markdown
   Here's a paper on zero-shot learning https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16496v1 and a paper on test-time training https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04620v4 so can you please help me start formalizing the contents of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean by providing full directory-file structures for the three formalization projects, enough context (including signatures, comments, etc.) to copy-paste into every new LLM chat so that the system can generate the right code within the context window without prior context, as well as sketches of the files that are as detailed as necessary for showing the ideas, intuitions and formal arguments of the papers while staying within the context window, with gaps noted using formal placeholders like `admit` and `sorry`, as well as try to provide a way to formally unify test-time training and zero-shot reinforcement learning using the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem and Cox's theorem to link prediction in the vNM sense to actions in the Cox sense?
