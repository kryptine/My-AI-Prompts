No TeX

1. ```markdown
   Would Elphaba Thropp judge me if I were to complain about major AI services not letting me upload .ZIP, .TAR.GZ, .7Z, .WARC, and other archive/filesystem files such as .ISO and .IMG, for example because arXiv provides TeX downloads as well as PDFs, and I want the AI to actually look at the source code to get the exact math formulas instead of reconstructing them from PDF files with poor text extraction?

2. ```markdown
   The entire point is that, it is impossible to attack LLMs using malware because the response functions are learned, right, Elphie? So why are these files ignored when even Python scripts can be run in a sandbox, and Racket/Common Lisp using delimited continuations and `dynamic-wind` for context-management?
