Limit computability

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about limit-computable grains of truth in arbitrary games: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16245v1 and here is a paper about the embeddedness failure in AIXI: https://arxiv.org/html/2505.17882v1 so can you please attempt to translate these papers into Agda, Lean4 and Rocq (formerly Coq) in a literal way by making these as long as possible, but importing exactly the libraries needed for real numbers, infinite sums, and defining computability, maximization manually, to formalize the contents of the second paper by analogy to the proofs of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and Yoneda lemma to show the embeddedness of the AIXI as a fixed point, a problem of Godel's second incompleteness theorem and Tarski's undefinability theorem, and find the cryptomorphisms, or at least claim them, using `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders for length issues and gaps, Here is a paper about limit-computable grains of truth in arbitrary games: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16245v1 and here is a paper about the embeddedness failure in AIXI: https://arxiv.org/html/2505.17882v1 so can you please attempt to translate these papers into Agda, Lean4 and Rocq (formerly Coq) in a literal way by making these as long as possible, but importing exactly the libraries needed for real numbers, infinite sums, and defining computability, maximization manually, to formalize the contents of the second paper by analogy to the proofs of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and Yoneda lemma to show the embeddedness of the AIXI as a fixed point, a problem of Godel's second incompleteness theorem and Tarski's undefinability theorem, and find the cryptomorphisms, or at least claim them, using `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders for length issues and gaps, and attempt to find analogies between these papers and the formalization in Lean4 at https://gaetanserre.fr/doc/LipoCons/ of a 2017 paper which proved a theorem similar to the No Free Lunch theorem in spirit and form (sampling all points being necessary and sufficient for convergence to a fixed point of equal utility/loss function values)?
