Impossibility

1. ```markdown
   This is a paper about the impossibility of feature attribution: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304406120 and here is a paper about the incentive compatibility of Nakamoto consensus: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.01448v1 so first translate these mathematical arguments, definitions, and proofs into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 as a starting point for formalizing the following ideas: Firstly, the impossibility of feature attribution is caused by the linear combinations of factors, which when expressed in terms of the mathematical theory, is cryptomorphically isomorphic to the linear homogeneity requirement for Nakamoto consensus; secondly, the argument against intellectual property can be bolstered by using formal proofs such as these, especially when translated for theorem provers, so translate these theorems as-is so that I can define other equivalent structures and reductions to these abstract structures of the proof to argue against intellectual property.
