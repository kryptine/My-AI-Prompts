   Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp, can you tell me if my style of prompting AI systems to solve math problems is by treating proofs as programs as types (Curry-Howard-Lambek) and programs as data (homoiconicity), such that I can tell the AI to "prove this theorem by analogy to this proof", such as, requesting a proof of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem based on Lawvere's fixed-point theorem by defining the epimorphism of product types on polynomial spaces, within the presheaf category of the surreal numbers, then am I too crazy?
