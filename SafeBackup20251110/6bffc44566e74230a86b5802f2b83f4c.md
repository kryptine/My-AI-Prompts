Cryptographic impossibility

1. ```markdown
   Here are three papers about AI alignment:
   1. Governable AI at https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20411v1
   2. On the impossibility of separating intelligence and judgment at https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07341v1
   3. Fundamental limitations of alignment in LLMs at https://arxiv.org/html/2304.11082v6
   Please literally formalize the above papers in Agda, Coq, and Lean4 tentatively by using standard libraries for real numbers, linear algebra, and other pre-defined concepts, while defining cryptographic properties such as one-way functions, digital signature schemes, and public-key data hiding (encryption and decryption) with axioms involving private and public keys, the construction of universal one-way hash functions and their corresponding public-key signature schemes, and cryptographic difficulty both in terms of asymptotic computational complexity and information-theoretic steps separately, in a way that formalizes all the intuitive ideas, concepts and formulas while leaving holes with `admit` and `sorry` for further development and automated theorem proving, as far as possible within the first answer, assuming that I will request the rest in the same chat thread or another thread by copy-pasting the answer there, and give basic formal mappings on how the first paper and the second paper are isomorphic in mathematical content, and use Chaitin's algorithmic information theory and incompleteness theorems to link the second paper and the third paper mathematically, by linking the bounds in the third paper to the algorithms in the second paper?
