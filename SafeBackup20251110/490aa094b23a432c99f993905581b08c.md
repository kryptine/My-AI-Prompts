Lambda

1. ```markdown
   Here are Oleg Kiselyov's writings about lambda calculus: https://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/lambda-calc.html so can you please translate his constructions for arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithm, comparison) as well as his lambda evaluators in Haskell and Scheme into Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda, and Lean literally, while also stating proofs of correctness of the arithmetic operations in lambda calculus, the correctness of the lambda evaluators, as well as the theorems about `call-cc`'s fixed-point being self-application described at https://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/callcc-calc-page.html please?

   By the way, am I right that definition 3 of the continuation monad in https://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/undelimited.html as `data Cont3 m x = Cont3 {runCont3 :: (x -> m Falsum) -> m Falsum` can be used to encode definition 4 `data Cont4 s g = Cont4 {runCont4 :: (g -> s) -> s}` by setting `m` to `Either s`, that is, `convert4to3 :: Cont4 f y -> Cont3 (Either f) y; convert4to3 (Cont4 p) = Cont3 (\q -> Left (p q))`, Elphie?
