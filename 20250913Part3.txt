Write Part 3 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Payor's lemma in natural language at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wmJT2j3rdT8ngFkPN/self-referential-probabilistic-logic-admits-the-payor-s and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iCDBQtby4L2fZ7yns/payor-s-lemma-in-natural-language based on these papers:

Pay attention to and formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure such as information theory, derivatives and other mathematical claims into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial MVP, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it. The point here is that paper 3 (CoT doesn't reduce jailbreaking) can also be seen as a statement that more compute (CoT) doesn't always reduce efficiency (harmlessness) if the problem isn't retargeted, according to Lipsey & Lancaster's theory of the second-best, which you should also show here in the general form, with application towards the case of limited compute.
