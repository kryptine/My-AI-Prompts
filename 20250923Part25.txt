Write Part 25 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the game-theoretic structure of the three papers, which are all zero-sum, and by unifying the formalisms of the papers by writing full Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations, with directory trees, by defining real closed fields, Blum-Shub-Smale machines, cylindrical algebraic decomposition and how they relate to each other by computability and decidability relationships, defining the major concepts, theorems and proofs within these papers. Please write the text section after the formalizations and also try to explain the theorems' formal expressions and proofs in summary form with the important steps crucial to the argument preserved and elaborated. In addition, please also state, formalize and prove theorems about the fundamental trade-off in AI alignment between preventing harmful uses (externally-directed harm) and intent divergence (self-directed harm). Please make the new theorems about the alignment tradeoff as rigorous as these papers, lengthening thinking time if needed to make full theorems with formal proofs in terms of the formalisms of the following papers. If possible, avoid directly quoting theorems from these papers and choose to isomorphically expand and generalize their arguments instead, quoting only if the arguments are too clever and long.
1. Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs https://arxiv.org/html/2509.00179v1
2. Formalizing Embeddedness Failures in Universal Artificial Intelligence https://arxiv.org/html/2505.17882v1
3. Substructural fixed-point theorems and the diagonal argument: theme and variations https://compositionality.episciences.org/13527 https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00239 https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/Diagonal.tex please explain how both the diagonal arguments and the fixed-point theorems in magmoidal categories can be proven by assuming Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as a lemma without proof, and also give alternate proofs for these theorems using Kleene's fixed-point theorem and the Knaster-Tarski fixed-point theorem. What about Sperner's lemma? Please prove "Lawvere => Roberts_Diagonal", "Lawvere => Roberts_FP", "Kleene => Roberts_FP", "Knaster-Tarski => Roberts_FP" and "Sperner => Roberts_Diagonal" without unwrapping the forall in each statement, because a universally true theorem is just a formula for which all topmost variable assignments cause the proposition to evaluate to true, making every variable in that formula "effectively not-free" in Metamath parlance, separately using 2 independent ideas: using the Cartesian closure (free Cartesian closed category, the category with just enough structure to contain the magmoidal category as a subcategory and to be Cartesian closed) of the magmoidal category with the diagonal `FreeCCC(MagmoidalDiagCat)` and the Cartesian closed category of presheaves `[MagmoidalDiagCat^op, Set]` to apply Lawvere's fixed-point theorem to.
