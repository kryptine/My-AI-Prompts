Write Part 5 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Payor's lemma proven separately in modal logic and Kripke frames at https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem and the theory of Stackelberg leader-follower games, generator-discriminator adversarial networks and variational autoencoders by identifying their mathematical isomorphisms:

Formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure such as information theory, derivatives and other mathematical claims into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial MVP, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it. In addition, say that the entire project of AI alignment hinges on LLMs' ability to generate code, formalisms, proofs, processes, experiments, which is what makes existential technological risks like biological risks and cybersecurity risks possible. Given that AI systems don't learn from single definitions or a small set of rules like the expert system CLIPS and functional programming languages like Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp and Scheme, but patch their knowledge from countless texts, lemmas, proofs, downstream uses, analogies, motivations, the real AI alignment question is about how to patch multiple complementary pieces of knowledge into a coherent whole, which is also the subject of mechanism design, how to combine multiple preference orders, loss functions, production endowments, etc. into a social decision, as shown by Shamir's secret k-out-of-n sharing algorithm and consensus protocols like Raft (please show their mathematical definitions in formal languages and state their information-theoretic security and epistemic impossibility below the threshold) showing that when even one piece of information is lost, the entire landscape shifts, according to Lipsey & Lancaster's theory of the second best and aliasing in the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem when the sampling frequency is below twice the maximum bandwidth of the signal.
