Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations?
1. How to prove Roberts' diagonal argument from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem without unwrapping the universal quantifiers in the statement 'if Lawvere, then Roberts'? That is, please give a proof as simple and clear as possible of the material conditional that if Lawvere's fixed-point theorem applies to all categories and morphisms within its domain (Cartesian closed categories, point-surjective maps), then Roberts' diagonal argument applies generally to its domain (magmoidal categories with the hash operator). You should use the presheaf category of the magmoidal category [Magmoidal^op, Set] or the free Cartesian closed category containing the magmoidal category FreeCCC(Magmoidal) as hints, by for example using the evaluation map of FreeCCC(Magmoidal) to find the deviant element, and please make independent proofs using both the forward form of Lawvere's theorem (the fixed point covariantly implies the existence of the deviant element) and the contrapositive (no fixed point for the endomorphism means that a deviant element exists). Please formalize the proofs in Agda, Coq and Lean4 and give natural-language explanations.
2. Prove the no-go theorem for universality using Roberts' diagonal argument as above, and prove the fixed-point theorem for target-context categories using Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as a lemma by considering both the presheaf category [TargetContext^op, Set] and the contravariant functor to its own Cartesian closure [TargetContext^op, FreeCCC(TargetContext)] for two independent proofs.
3. Prove the Knaster-Tarski and Bourbaki-Witt theorems, used in domain theory, using Lawvere's fixed-point theorem by considering the Cartesian closed categories `Cpo` and `Dcpo`. Prove Lob's theorem using Lawvere's fixed-point theorem by using the category of models of Godel-Lob provability logic. How does the claim that radical transparency is paradoxical conflict with Lobian fixed-point cooperation and open-source game theory in which each agent receives the source code of all other agents as shown in https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2WpPRrqrFQa6n2x3W/modal-fixpoint-cooperation-without-loeb-s-theorem and can I explain this as cheap talk vs. binding commitments?
