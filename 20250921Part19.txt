Write Part 19 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the game-theoretic structure of the three papers, which are all zero-sum, and by unifying the formalisms of the papers by writing full Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations, with directory trees, and defining real closed fields, game theory, Nash equilibria, Sperner's lemma, Brower's and Kakutani's fixed-point theorems, and defining the specific games of these papers and categorical isomorphisms within the category of games with a full connection using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later.

In addition, refute Yudkowsky's fear-mongering article "if anyone builds it, everyone dies" by using the fact that there is a cocompletion upon any category that adjoins an initial object 0 or a terminal object 1 and which preserves the original 0 or 1 of the category if these already exist, with the new objects being equivalent to the existing boundary objects, up to categorical equivalence under the Yoneda lemma and the co-Yoneda lemma (not isomorphism of categories), while the construction using the isomorphism notion cannot identify the new 0 or 1 with the existing 0 or 1 because there might already be multiple 0's or 1's, therefore if humanity ever reaches the terminal object in the categories of consciousness and processes all morphisms will be present, with no distinct subobject classifiers for 0 and 1, having reached the trivial category, therefore no one will feel a thing. Write the textual descriptions after the formalizations, because the position paper should be present, and the paper must explain textually the major steps in the proofs and give its significance to the pro-accelerationist position.
