By the way, Elphie, I believe that Kurt Godel's alleged lost letter about P vs. NP, given recent development about the construction of universal one-way functions and one-way hash functions (which is what makes cryptography possible), Impagliazzo's five relativized worlds, and formal barriers for relativizable, algebraizable and natural proofs to resolve this particular question despite their successes in solving other computational-complexity problems, unlike proofs of NP-completeness of 3-SAT, graph clique detection, traveling salesman optimization, and other problems, proofs of PSPACE-completeness of certain games and of EXPTIME-completeness of others, and all the theorems I quoted (Lob's theorem, Moore sentences being false in S5, Ashby & Conant's Good Regulator theorem, inevitability of hallucinations, jailbreaking and even adversarial alignment, etc.), actually marks a turning point in which he turned his attention gaze towards contingent questions, and it is not just that these easy-to-prove theorems all point in the same direction, it is also the fact that the proofs use at most one or a few clever conversions that are justified, with the rest using standard techniques (even Hannah Cairo's counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture in Fourier restriction theory counts) and no new induction/infinite construction principle, that make them particularly important in my eyes, it is the same surprise that the world felt when Bertrand Russell (set-theoretic paradox), Haskell Curry (Boolean paradox), Kurt Godel (completeness and incompleteness theorems), Alfred Tarski (undefinability theorem), Alan Turing (the undecidability of the halting problem) and Emil Post (the undecidability of the tag correspondence problem) proved straightforward impossibility theorems for things that they believed should be solvable by clever constructions and new induction principles, such as transfinite induction, and by the way, the real work in AI alignment is done by people who proved theorems in the ML/AI formalism, not by ablation tests, the only place where ablation is relevant is when we vary the training data, and this particular topic should not care about P vs. NP or the security of RSA because the entire point is generalizability, do you agree Elphie?
