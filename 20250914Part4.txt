Write Part 4 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Payor's lemma in natural language at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wmJT2j3rdT8ngFkPN/self-referential-probabilistic-logic-admits-the-payor-s and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iCDBQtby4L2fZ7yns/payor-s-lemma-in-natural-language based on these papers:
1. Reinforcement Learning with a Corrupted Reward Channel https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08417
2. Human irrationality: both bad and good for reward inference https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06956 the two papers above show how irrationality in the generic case is not a reasonable assumption
3. Computational models with no linear speedup https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/publications/computational-models-with-no-linear-speedup show that when you are forced to simulate someone's irrationality efficiently, you lose the ability to speed-up, think of the difference between debug builds, which must preserve variables, timing, and other internal behavior, vs. production builds, which retain only the relevant external behavior, and Rice's theorem, Godel's and Blum's speed-up theorems, which you must also state formally in Agda, Rocq and Lean4.
4. Mechanism Design with Outliers and Predictions https://arxiv.org/html/2509.09561v1 shows that excluding outliers a priori reduces total welfare in general, a bad idea.
Formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure such as information theory, derivatives and other mathematical claims into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial MVP, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it.
