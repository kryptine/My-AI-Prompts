1. A 2-Categorical Bridge Between Henkin Constructions and Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem: Unifying Completeness and Compactness https://arxiv.org/html/2504.03797v1
2. An Invitation to Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond https://arxiv.org/html/2406.16607v1 (a summary of A Framework for Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond at https://doi.org/10.46298/compositionality-6-3 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06851 which shows how many universal constructions arise as instances of a general schema in mathematics)
Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please consider generalizations of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem to the magmoidal case and the topological case, and please give alternative proofs from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem to the generalizations provided within these articles, by using Lawvere's theorem as a lemma and considering relevant Cartesian closed categories, such as presheaf categories [C^op, Set], [C^op, Dcpo] or even free Cartesian closed categories of these topological and magmoidal categories and applying Lawvere's fixed-point theorem to them, and can you please formalize the implications of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem for the ethics of radical transparency? Can you please use logical induction and infra-Bayesian searches, which are the same method of enumerating all your options like AIXI and Levin's universal search and Blum's speed-up theorem to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations? In addition, can you please write a short argument using Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and the implications as listed within the first paper to argue against controls for AI system by showing that centralized control leads to paradoxes, much like Blum's speed-up theorem as shown in https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19670048768 and https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/08/favorite-theorems-abstract-complexity.html in which controlling computation time as a complexity measure leads to speed-ups?
