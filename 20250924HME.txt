Can you explain how homomorphic encryption works, give me initial formalizations of the major fully homomorphic encryption algorithms in Agda, Coq and Lean4 by defining number fields and other concepts as shown in the textbook of Fully Homomorphic Encryption at https://fhetextbook.github.io/ and https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136 and can you draft a formalization for the proof that every fully homomorphic encryption scheme mentioned in this book can be made information-theoretically secure by making the key size equal to or larger than the input size, with a textbox that I can copy into other chats for further formalizations of the gaps, which should be marked with `admit` and `sorry`, and can you tell me how to adapt the algorithms in https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07341v1 to allow the user to shield themselves from misaligned AI systems and https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20411v1 to fully secure AI systems, unifying their theory with information-theoretically secure homomorphic encryption schemes by universal one-way functions and universal one-way hash functions according to Levin's construction, as well as formalize Blum's speed-up theorem and their applicability to these problems?
