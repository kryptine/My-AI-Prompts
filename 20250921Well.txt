Well, there are many theorems I can use to attack Yudkowsky's position, for example the research on HoTT, statistical learning bounds, differential privacy, and other topics in theoretical machine learning, as well as formalizations of security and consensus in blockchains and differential privacy in theorem provers, suggests that computer security is theoretically a solved problem, and the advent of LLMs suggests that this can be automated at scale with human direction, contrary to Yudkowsky's claims about computer security, dependent types and other verified programming paradigms allow fully secure software that evades all these things like buffer overflow
