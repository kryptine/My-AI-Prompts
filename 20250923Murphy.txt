Can you help me write part 1 of the Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the paradigms such as PAC-Bayes learning bounds and Rademacher complexity to statistical learning theory and Transformer architectural models? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now, it's just incremental. Can you use these ideas to refute the claim that training data should be filtered to prevent misalignment, and can you attempt to formalize the intuition that there is a tradeoff between user-caused harm (misuse) and self-caused harm (misalignment) using the formalisms of these papers? What kind of arguments and theorems would be used? If you can come up with a complete proof, by all means try to do so, else I will return later in other chats. https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dEiBJDtSmbC8dChwe/what-training-data-should-developers-filter-to-reduce-risk-1 What I mean is, can you state and prove internal-external harm tradeoffs using PAC-Bayes bounds, Rademacher complexity, Good-Turing estimates, compression failures, each one using a separate proof, by showing the arguments step-by-step without referring to the papers, with explicit mathematical quantities and formulas and derivational reductions, taking inspiration only for the arguments while editing them for the statements I want to prove here, explicitly referring to the theorems in the paper only if it is too long?
