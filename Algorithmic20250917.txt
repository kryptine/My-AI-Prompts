Here are papers about algorithmic collusion and systemic communication:
1. Online Optimization Algorithms in Repeated Price Competition: Equilibrium Learning and Algorithmic Collusion https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15707v1
2. Algorithmic Collusion Without Threats https://arxiv.org/html/2409.03956v2
3. https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013170
Can you please help me formalizing these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by explicitly defining the basic concepts of machine learning, neural networks, defining Nash equilibria, Sperner's lemma, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, reinforcement learning, the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later, and also find commonalities between the formal aspects of these theorems, by categorically unifying using type theory and category theory the "encoder/decoder/transmitter/receiver" of flat white noise with the AI systems in algorithmic-collusion algorithms, and the "white noise" as the latent signals?
