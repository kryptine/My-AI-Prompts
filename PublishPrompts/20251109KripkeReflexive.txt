Can you tell me, according to the page https://www.ontology.co/essays/deontic-logic.pdf what  axiom is missing from the deontic logics that would be present in the corresponding alethic logics as said in the article that would mean "anything that happens, however evil, is permitted"? Am I right that this statement, interpreted formally as Square = Necessary = Obligatory and Diamond = Possible = Permissible, is `X -> Diamond(X)`, which is the same thing as `X -> not Square(not X)` and therefore by contrapositive `Square(not X) -> not X`, making it as a generic axiom equivalent to `Square(Y) -> Y` for every Y? Am I right that this axiom says that the Kripke frames are reflexive?
