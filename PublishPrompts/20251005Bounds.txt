Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please show the specific isomorphisms and correspondences between the papers' definitions, theorems and proofs, like the various definitions of topological spaces based on open/closed sets, neighborhoods, closures and boundaries, by finding and enumerating abstractions until the forward and backward substitutions work categorically like adjoint functors, with focus on the hints I provide here?
Can you please unify the multi-armed bandits with the games with many players by making the arms and the players analogous to each other, and do the same with online decision making with sets of probability distributions, by showing the analogies and isomorphisms between these papers that naturally transform between the theorems?
