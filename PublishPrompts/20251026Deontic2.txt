Please spell out the steps of the proofs present within the papers in the formalizations, with only omitted details replaced with placeholders. Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Isabelle/HOL and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Agda, Isabelle/HOL and Lean4 alternately.
In addition, can you please tell me how to formalize incomplete information and Harsanyi's claim that uncertainty over states of the game reduces to uncertainty over payoffs, and attempt to find equivalents that are proven within these papers or synthesize them yourself if they don't exist, and relate the logics KD45 and S5, which are often used to model game theoretic reasoning and strategy, with these deontic logics by analyzing how they model extensive-form games with complete and incomplete information, and attempting to find correspondences between them?
===
Let's start with analyzing how standard S5 and KD4.5 modal logic describes extensive-form games of complete and incomplete information, and compare it with the deontic-logic approaches here, and from that derive a way to construct a model of doxastic-alethic logics like S5 and KD45 from deontic logics like DS5 and DS4.5 by finding minimal conversion schemes that is consistent with how logics analyze the same game-theoretic situations.
== Please emphasize the analysis of S5, DS5, KD4.5, DS4.5, and similar logics by attempting to find a full correspondence between them in terms of game theory and modal logic (S5 + DS5 = complete information, DS4.5 + KD4.5 = incomplete information ==
