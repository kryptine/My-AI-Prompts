Write Part 17 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the precise formal forms and proofs of the following resources, making the position paper's argument align with the formal content of the proofs step-by-step in a way that does not need to necessarily reproduce every step but must still show isomorphisms, by formalizing the algorithms in the three papers in Agda, Rocq and Lean4 in a way that's generic for the utility/loss function and the metaheuristic by accepting three additional parameters: a Boolean flag that's true when the "economic convention" (utility function) is used and false when the "ML convention" (loss function) is used, the utility/loss function, the metaheuristic (gradient descent, hill climbing, simulated annealing, etc.), formalizing the significant theorems, lemmas and proofs in the three papers, and filling in the proof for papers 1 and 3 by showing that in informationally dense environment in which the principal can combine his own data to the data of all other n-1 agents to derive the last agent's data, any outcome in the convex hull of a feasible set is achievable, using the linearity properties of the algorithms in papers 1 and 3?

2. Intersectional Fairness in Reinforcement Learning with Large State and Constraint Spaces https://arxiv.org/html/2502.11828v1
3. Disproving the Feasibility of Learned Confidence Calibration Under Binary Supervision: An Information-Theoretic Impossibility https://arxiv.org/html/2509.14386v1
In addition, can you please help me formalize these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by explicitly defining the basic concepts of the paper such as loss functions, neural networks, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, probability theory, information theory among others, all the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later?
