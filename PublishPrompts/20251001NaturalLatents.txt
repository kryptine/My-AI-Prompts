Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please attempt to enumerate every possible substitution, to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations for all these content, to provide solutions to my requests below?
Please unify the contents of the three systems and give tables of isomorphisms between the three papers, showing the corresponding concepts in a correspondence table and a "unit-conversion" table showing how to convert formulaically each paper's formalism to each other's, by defining and naming the right kinds of categories (copy-delete categories, dagger-compact monoidal categories, Cartesian closed categories) in which to represent the contents of the papers faithfully, taking into account the theorems proven in https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/Diagonal.tex to show how the contents of these papers relate to each other?
