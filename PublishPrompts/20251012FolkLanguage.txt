Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Agda, Rocq and Lean4 alternately.
1. What is the relationship between the constructions for noise, loss and density measures in papers 2 and 3?
2. Can you please construct a relationship between folk theorems (and anti-folk theorems) in economics and language generation in the limit by treating every string as a coarse-graining of the action/outcome space for players and extending to continuous spaces, or by continuously mapping manifolds to the convex hulls of action sets and providing monotonic mappings from the repeated game's utility space to the continuous game's utility space?
