   Requests:
   1. Can you please define the common ideas and explain what each paper shows for me? What is the current status of this literature? What are the newest contributions to continuous mechanism design for Walrasian and Lindahl equilibria?
   2. Can you tell me the difference between "fully budget balanced" and "weakly budget balanced"? In addition, what is the minimum deficit of budget balance in weakly budget balance? Is there a parameter that you can adjust to make this failure of strong budget balance arbitrarily small? If not, where does the minimum strong budget balance penalty come from, and how is it calculated?
   3. Can you help me write the the SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of the main definitions, theorems, and proofs, that is, the repeated concepts should be done once, with the theorems formalized, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big, but if it's incomplete, also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. Please explain the content in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 alternately.
