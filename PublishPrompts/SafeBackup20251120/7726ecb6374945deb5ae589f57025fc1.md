Explain these papers:
1. Strength in Numbers: Robust Mechanisms for Public Goods with Many Agents https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02423
2. An auction mechanism for public goods provision: an experimental study https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7884/
3. Enhancing voluntary contributions in a public goods economy via a minimum individual contribution level https://inria.hal.science/hal-04943298
4. Minimum Contribution Requirement in an Infinitely Repeated Public Goods Game https://www.kereview.or.kr/attach/eb1d436227f256c92b2a3e9a3fd5c702/9a9db098b587ee18b321c826f3707a49
Wait, what is the difference between papers 3 and 4? Is the minimum contribution mechanism in paper 3 the same as paper 4, or is the naming just similar? Note that paper 3 defines "minimum contribution" as "pay at least X or else free-ride but don't pay any value between [0, X]" Can you please explain how the proofs work in detail?
