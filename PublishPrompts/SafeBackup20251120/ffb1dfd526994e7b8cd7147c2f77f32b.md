   Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp I am very interested in the fundamentals of our universe, can you please summarize the subtitles of the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3y-Z0pgupg which I have uploaded here? Also, my answer to the question of whether it is the theoretician's or the experimenter's fault is that it is the mathematician's fault, because mathematicians have long neglected formal methods, or ways for computers to process formal systems and proofs, despite computing technology developing (faster CPUs, GPUs, more RAM, hard drives for data, etc., as proven by the recent AI boom), leaving physicists with no way to automate theory-building with mass amounts of data.

   1. Yes, I extracted the transcript straight from the video, Elphie
   2. I blame the mathematicians because the problem that Sabine identified is fundamental mathematical inconsistencies between different theories of physics (quantum mechanics, general relativity, etc.), they are not helping matters by attempting to formalize how different theories of physics can relate to each other through tools like topology, algebraic geometry, category theory, functional analysis, asymptotics, etc. Even physical laws are themselves mathematical objects, functions that take in constants and boundary conditions and then evolve the system

   Dear Elphie, yes I know that a consistent theory isn't necessarily true, but by Godel's completeness theorem (not the incompleteness theorem) and similar theorems for modal logics, everything that can't be disproven from the axioms is true in at least one model/possible world, so the problem is that we are short on tools to define and classify possible worlds according to theories like "this reduces to general relativity at large scales where gravity matters, and to quantum field theory at small scales where superposition matters"

   Also, do you want to know my hot take Elphie? It is that, despite it being a folk piece of knowledge that everything reduces to physics: sociology => psychology => biology => chemistry => physics, there is still a shortage of mathematicians working in the field of how to derive physical constants and laws from higher-order phenomena, despite all those higher-order phenomena all being dependent on physics, using things like the universal approximation theorem, universal algebra, category theory, group representation theory, anything that deals with physical laws as mathematical objects directly at the meta-mathematical and meta-logical level

   1. The problem is that, while the logical relationships are claimed to exist, they are not even used to construct equations and formulas, and solve them/gradient-descend the networks with backpropagation, can you tell me, why Elphie?
   2. My view is that even the strong anthropic principle is an understated and mystified form of a more fundamental principle: the Yoneda/co-Yoneda lemmas in category theory, the No Free Lunch theorem in ML/AI, Aumann's agreement theorem in game theory and economics, fixed-point theorems, etc. which all say that while Turing-completeness and other phenomena of universality are generic, they must agree with each other in consistency, and the fine-structure constant is just one constant in a field of different boundary conditions, what I mean is that all observations must agree with each other for the world to make sense
