Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp here are my requests for you:
1. Can you help me write the the Isabelle/HOL, Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of the main definitions, theorems, and proofs, that is, the repeated concepts should be done once, with the theorems formalized, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big, but if it's incomplete, also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats if you can't do everything in one go (although I would prefer that). I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. Please explain the content in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Isabelle/HOL, Agda, Coq and Lean4 alternately.
2. Can you please tell me with intuitive explanations what the failure of compactness in paper 3 means and what their conceptual equivalents are in the other papers? Can you focus the formalization for these impossibility results like the failure of compactness? Am I right that the fact that logics of permitted announcements are in general non-compact means that the entire concept of forbidden announcements and knowledge is self-referential and cannot be checked from within?
