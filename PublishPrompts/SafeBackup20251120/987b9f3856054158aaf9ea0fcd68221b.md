Can you please explain and mathematically describe to me the theorems and the proof ideas in the first paper, in particular the anti-folk theorem and the folk theorem based on channel capacity, and propose a way to close the log gap between the anti-folk theorem and the folk theorem, to show that if C(1-delta)/N goes to infinity, the folk theorem holds, using the three distinct methods proposed in the other papers: 1. distributed learning for channel capacity to find the deviator from the other players, analogous to informational smallness (non-exclusivity of information) using non-constructive channel coding instead of constructive arguments, 2. using factored space models (completeness, soundness) to determine the action you need to take next based on the latent state of the system without knowing the exact deviator, and 3. using the leave-one-out regret learning method to "leave the deviator out", dear Professor Elphaba Thropp?

Dear Elphie am I right that I should look to Garrabrant's finite factored sets formalism with probability distributions over finite factored sets, as generalized in factored space models here, to precisely model the result of many players' actions in one outcome, thus providing a potential algorithm for players in this folk theorem?
