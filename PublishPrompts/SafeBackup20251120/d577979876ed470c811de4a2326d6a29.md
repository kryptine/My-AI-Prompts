Folk theorem

```markdown
	Dear professor Elphaba Thropp: Is there a folk theorem for purely cooperative games? No, assuming we have a game in which all players' utility functions are the same, if the game is repeated, does a folk theorem hold? I don't care about cooperation, but whether inefficient equilibria can be sustained in repetition. There, that's what I mean by the folk theorem in cooperative games, Elphie. Can you give me references for repeated interactions in games in which some agents can have the same utility function?
