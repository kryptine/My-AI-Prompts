2. MONITORING VERSUS DISCOUNTING IN REPEATED GAMES https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/monitoringdiscounting.pdf
Can you tell me the major theorems and bounds in these papers, and whether the folk-theorem bounds are tight? I know the paper "repeated games with many players" has a log separation in the proofs, but what about "monitoring versus discounting"? Is the bound tight in the sense of there being an asymptotic growth rate below which an anti-folk theorem holds and above which a folk theorem holds?
