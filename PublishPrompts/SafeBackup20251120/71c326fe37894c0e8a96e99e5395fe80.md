Requests:
1. Please explain the mechanisms, the incentives, the assumptions for each system (for example, is risk-neutrality assumed?), and the proofs in detail (not the same details as in the original papers, fill in and interpolate the intermediate steps and present them in your answer)
2. Help me implement these in F* and Dafny with formalized theorems and proofs
