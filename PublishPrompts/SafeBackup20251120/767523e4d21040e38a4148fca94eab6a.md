   Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp what exactly is wrong with this whitepaper? https://github.com/ak1484/A_Grand_Unified_Theory_of_Universal_Language_Models_Paper That is, the author seems to make analogies between cosmic phenomena and Transformer phenomena, can you attempt to make these rigorous by considering the generic forms of the equations that he has made for both Transformers and general relativity, finding common reductions between them, and show how they are equivalent? If you can't, can you tell me how the author came up with this? Is this written under "the influence of a sycophantic AI LLM" as an AI reviewer has said?
