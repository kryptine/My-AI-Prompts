   Here is the paper "Limit-computable grains of truth": https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16245 with "Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization": https://arxiv.org/html/2505.08727 and "Digital goods monopoly" https://arxiv.org/html/2507.13137v5 so can you help me start formalizing these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 by proposing directory/file structures, providing global context that can be copied into every new thread to formalize each file so that the APIs, interfaces and code are compatible across tries, by importing from standard libraries only real numbers, complex numbers and linear algebra, with probability, statistics, information theory, computability theory, and game theory as functions formalized from scratch, with the global context in formalized or at least mathematical-formula form instead of natural language so that it can be understood by parsing, and help me unify the three papers by treating the recursive computation in the limit of the first paper as isomorphic to the iteration of folk theorems by identifying the computation of other agents' strategies in the limit with the consideration of the strategies of the previous rounds in the folk theorem and the memorization-compression cycles?
