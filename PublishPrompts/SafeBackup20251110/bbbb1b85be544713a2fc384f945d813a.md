Yoneda

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers on category theory: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08340 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08663 which both contain proofs of the Yoneda lemma as described at https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma and the co-Yoneda lemma as described at https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/co-Yoneda+lemma can you please translate the arguments literally into Agda, Coq (Rocq) and Lean, with informal parts spelled out and the gaps filled with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` to answer my question of whether the Yoneda lemma and the co-Yoneda lemma in the sense of Kan/MacLane can both be proven using Lawvere's fixed-point theorem in the functor categories [D,Set] and [C_op,Set], using the fact that `Set` is a Cartesian closed category, and so are `Cpo` and `Dcpo`? In addition, can you extend these results to the Yoneda lemma and the Kan/MacLane co-Yoneda lemma when using `Cpo` and `Dcpo`-valued presheaves instead of standard `Set`-valued ones?
