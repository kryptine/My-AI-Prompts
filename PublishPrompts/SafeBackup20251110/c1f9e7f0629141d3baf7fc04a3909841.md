avataRL

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "avataRL" https://tokenbender.com/post.html?id=avatarl and here is the code: https://github.com/tokenbender/avataRL/raw/refs/heads/main/avatarl.py and https://github.com/tokenbender/avataRL/raw/refs/heads/main/model.py so can you please recreate the entire model architecture but generalized to mixture-of-experts, including the reinforcement learning layer, into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, and give sketches for the theorem that minimizing reinforcement-learning loss in avataRL is equivalent to minimizing cross-entropy loss with the same model hyperparameters and different training parameters such as learning rates? What needs to be changed so that the training data and the model design stay the same, but the results change to be as similar to avataRL as possible? That is, can we reduce avataRL into traditional pretraining by redefining the cross-entropy loss function or learning rate?
