Theory

   Can you tell me how to model contracts within game theory? That is, let's start with the problem of real estate. Real estate can be considered subspaces of a space (any set `S`) that can be cut apart and traded. `S` is a Boolean algebra to support non-ownership (complements), sharing (union) and stewardship (intersection). Now if each owner can do what he wants with what he owns, then we have a Boolean-algebra homomorphism from the space of things `S` to the space of actions `T` that defines what can be done with each piece of property, where `T` is the total space of feasible actions on `S`. This can also be expressed as dividing `S` into distinct owners, then allowing each owner to define a function from the Cartesian product of all others' action space to theirs that preserves subset monotonicity so that the more others tighten their subsets the more you tighten yours, as well as an alternative definition based on Cartesian products of strategy sets mapped to results, in which control is transferred by first creating a Cartesian product that is surjected to the original choice space, and then sending some of the sets to others, such that two ways of parameterizing strategies are equivalent if and only if the equivalence relations of same results regardless of others' choices result in the same equivalence classes, such that the same strategy can be arbitrarily split or merged without changing the strategic nature of the game for each player, let's just consider the case of finitely many players first to see if we can prove equivalence between these two views of contract and a third view based on program equilibrium in which each person's strategy space is defined as a program that takes all others' programs as input and outputs a strategy of the original strategy space, can you please formalize the three definitions and try to prove folk theorems for each of them? In addition, is there a universal property for the Cartesian-product split of strategy spaces into sets equivalent up to equivalence under all others' strategies that allows us to remove the ad-hoc equivalence relation and define the structure more directly in terms of tuples, sums, functions, and other set-theoretic operations? Can you please use the contents of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07006 as a hint?
