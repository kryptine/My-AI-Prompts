AI impossibility

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "On the impossibility of hallucination control in large language models" https://arxiv.org/html/2506.06382v4 and here is the paper "On the mathematical impossibility of safe universal approximators" https://arxiv.org/html/2507.03031v1 so help me start formalizing these theorems in Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda, and Lean and in addition, translate the argument using the universal approximation theorem to the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem for Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, as well as the language of the Turing-completeness of Transformers and RNNs by analogy?
