Mechanistic interpretability

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about mechanistic interpretability < https://arxiv.org/html/2501.16496v1 > Please use the content and especially the mathematical constructions, theorems and proofs of these papers: Neural Field Turing Machine < https://arxiv.org/html/2509.03370v1 >, Attribution Projection Calculus < https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12094v1 > and Causal Interventions Beyond Time < https://arxiv.org/html/2508.04737v1 >, provide a starting point for formalization of these papers in Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean4, with full or sparse file/directory trees and a copiable header, including things like concepts, interfaces, APIs, in as much formal mathematical language as possible, minimizing reliance on natural-language descriptions and identifiers, with gaps noted with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry`, that will be copied into every new chat for formalization of each part, importing only the standard library for the basic operations on the real numbers (4 operations, limits, calculus), explicitly defining pi with at least claims if not proof sketches for equivalences between both unit circle-based (x^2 + y^2 = 1) definitions based on arc length and area, Chudnovsky's formula, the Brent-Salamin iterative formula and the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula, prove the decidability and elementary recursive membership (ELEMENTARY) of real closed fields using quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic decomposition, the Turing-completeness of Transformers (Perez et al.), RNNs (Siegelmann) and neural field Turing machines using a common core procedure of mapping these networks to machines that compute and compare real numbers symbolically (Blum-Shub-Smale machines) and single-stepping real closed field logical inference operations by treating the solver like a single step of a Turing machine, to argue that mechanistic interpretability is impossible due to Rice's theorem, Tarski's undefinability theorem, both incompleteness theorems by Godel separately, and Godel's completeness and compactness theorems (argue that, since LLMs and generative AI models are theories of the world, they are consistent with all worlds that match their generation patterns and behavior and no other worlds due to completeness, and multiple AI models can be combined to create a world model like sheaves forming a global section due to compactness), and use the conceptual theories of the causal theories (also formalized by explicitly defining probability theory with sigma-algebras and measure theory, defining utility functions as to be maximized and loss to be minimized, and prove equivalence between utility maximization, loss minimization and compression using Kraft's inequality between the sum of all prefix codes and 1, showing equivalence between AIXI and compression, with the deficit as death) to prove that mechanistic interpretability must be based on actions you can actually take, and optimization over all computable Solomonoff priors is uncomputable in the limit (proven in 2015), and only other variants are computable in the limit or decidable, and prove other theorems necessary to argue that to actually interpret an AI system, since they are defined by a probability distribution from a fixed training dataset (making the training process a Kleisli arrow to a Giry probability monad or a Markov kernel in a Markov category from the set of possible training datasets to the set of probability distributions over models), the probability distribution themselves can be treated as the deterministic outcome of training, and therefore you cannot interpret the AI without interpreting how you interpret the training data and how it interprets it, using literate programming practices while putting as much information as possible into the syntax instead of the comments or the identifiers, with the natural-language parts extended if and only if you have space for the context window.
