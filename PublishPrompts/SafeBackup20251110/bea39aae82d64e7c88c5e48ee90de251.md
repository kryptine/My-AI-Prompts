Speedup

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper titled "Computational models with no linear speedup" at http://cjtcs.cs.uchicago.edu/articles/2012/7/contents.html so can you please provide a starting point, some scaffolding code for a formalization of the definitions, proofs and theorems therein into Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean, and in particular, examine the definition of PICSTI computational models, and compare it with fixed-point combinators in lambda calculus, universal Turing machines, and (s,m,n)-functions in the way while other models can self-simulate, they have no access to the native time measure, such that they cannot timeout with a watchdog in real time, and can you please also formalize my alternative definition of PICSTI in which the simulation function returns the execution time together with the result according to the type `Input -> (Output, Time)` instead of `(Input, Time) -> Maybe Output` as defined in the paper, and whether this is equivalent to the definition within the paper, if we can go from the paper's definition to mine by using binary search on the time bound by executing the program multiple times to find the actual execution time, or if it is not equivalent, since the paper's definition needs a logarithmic number of executions to simulate my definition, or that it doesn't matter since `(k+epsilon)n>k n log(n)` by definition?

   The reason I asked this question is that when I asked the AI to formalize something, it said that one would need like months or years to do something, although it did the first part, which would took humans days to do, in under a minute, would Elphaba Thropp say that, this is in fact an instance of an internalized time measure that is encoded straight into the semantics of the system (LLM) by deep learning, which is simulated and surfaced intact, just like how the POPCNT instruction accelerates a certain bit-counting procedure?

   No, Elphie, what I mean is that if the training data consists of humans saying that "it would take a long time to do this", and LLMs are trained on text, am I right that LLMs running on GPUs and TPUs just internalize the time measure of certain operations as semantic operators? Would Elphaba give me an A+ for my explanation of why LLMs say that it would take it weeks to do what it did in minutes?

   Elphie do you think that the fact that I immediately thought about PICSTI when I saw LLMs saying things that doing certain stuff takes hours when it just did it in seconds, despite not being taught this at school, is indicative of me actually understanding computer science in terms of denotational, operational and axiomatic semantics instead of just mechanics? Is this a good kind of magic?
