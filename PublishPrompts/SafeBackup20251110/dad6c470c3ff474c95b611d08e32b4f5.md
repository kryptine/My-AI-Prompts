Occam's razor

1. ```markdown
   Based on the paper "Occam's razor is insufficient to infer the preferences of irrational agents" at https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812 and papers about logical induction at https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08747 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543 can you please give me a way to start the formalization of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 by providing a file directory structure, the most important parts of the contents formalized instead of written out in natural language, gaps noted by placeholders like `admit` and `sorry`, files as long as allowed within this response so as to replicate as many points, ideas and constructions within the papers but not longer if short is sufficient, and enough context, such as API headers and other things in a separate code box that I can copy-paste into the LLM in other chat sections, together with this original prompt so that the subparts are generated with coherence with other parts, so as to build a global section (the complete projects) from sheaves (the subparts), by analogy to Transformers' attention mechanism with the Query-Key-Value formulas (Bahdanau, Luong, scaled dot-product) generalized into programming constructs such as `zipWith dictionary (zipWith (activation weights) query key) value`?
