Unlearning

1. ```markdown
   Here is a paper about making AI systems unlearn harmful concepts, can you please translate the existing formalisms, formulas, and proofs within the paper into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 as a starting point for full formalization, as well as try to translate the contents of the paper into the following alternative formulations: using the central limit theorem in probability theory to destroy certain information within the model by repeatedly convolving a particular dimension to cause convergence to a normal/Gaussian distribution that respects all other dimensions; removing axioms from a first-order or Henkin-semantics logical theory (in which Godel's completeness theorem, compactness theorem and the Lowenheim-Skolem apply, which all show a deep isomorphism between model theory and proof theory when applied to first-order/Henkin theories); removing equations from a variety or quasivariety in universal algebra; removing production rules from an unrestricted grammar or a semi-Thue string rewriting system; removing instructions from a universal Turing machine; removing combinators from a universal combinatory logic base; and can you tell me whether if relearning is prevented, can't we diagonalize the process by comparing a model in which these concepts were never present in the first place to a model with relearning prevented to find the forbidden knowledge by a technique similar to forcing in set theory?
