No free lunch theorems

```markdown
Elphie, am I right to say that "the only free lunches you get in mathematics, CS, ML and AI are no-free-lunch theorems such as Godel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, the Yoneda lemma, the co-Yoneda lemma, Godel's completeness and compactness theorems, which all state that what you can know and do is constrained by what you have"?

   Here are papers on NFL-style theorems:
   1. Tensor machine-learning models: https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05674v1
   2. Human-AI collaboration: https://arxiv.org/html/2411.15230v1
   3. Privacy-preserving inference: https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20681v3
   Dear Elphaba Thropp, can you give me the first part of formalizations in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 of these theorems with a unifying schema for no-free-lunch structures in terms of type-theoretic or category-theoretic definitions of the problem domain, the solution space and the definition of a "free lunch", with directory structures, formalizations as far as possible into formal language instead of natural language, with natural-language identifiers and comments reduced to formal structure whenever possible, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` for gaps, and with a header bounded in a code box containing APIs, information, ideas, anything enough to copy into other chats and formalize each file, with each directory possibly creating its own context?
