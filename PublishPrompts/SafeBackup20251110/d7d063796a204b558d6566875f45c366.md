   Here are papers about category theory:
   1. Braided monoidal categories http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~street/JS1.pdf which is summarized at https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/symmetric_mult_braided.tex
   2. Many finite-dimensional lifting bundle gerbes are torsion https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07936v3
   Can you please give me formalized notation of the propositions, theorems and proofs of these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean with full directory structures, placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` for gaps, but please translate the structure of these papers and expand the concepts into formal notation, with natural-language identifiers and comments only having a supplementary role? Can you please formalize the diagrams of the paper in these languages for me to read them independently of the text? Given that the first paper was OCR'ed, can you reconstruct the intended content by formalization?
