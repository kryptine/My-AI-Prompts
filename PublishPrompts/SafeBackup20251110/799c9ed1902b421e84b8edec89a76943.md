Counterfactuals

1. ```markdown
   Here are two papers about counterfactuals:
   1. Path to counterfactuals: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.20371v1
   2. Counterfactual scenarios for automated planning: https://arxiv.org/html/2508.21521v1
   Can you please show me the major mathematical results of these papers, in terms of the main arguments, theorems and proofs, in terms of proof sketches in Coq, Agda and Lean4, using standard libraries for real numbers and linear algebra, with gaps for formalization and expansion using `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders, with inline natural-language explanations for what needs to be done to fully formalize, including the main ideas behind the proofs?
