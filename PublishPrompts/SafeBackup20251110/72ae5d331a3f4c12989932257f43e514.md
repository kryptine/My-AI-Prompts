Neural Turing machines

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "Neural Field Turing machine": https://arxiv.org/html/2509.03370 the paper "ask, and it shall be given" https://arxiv.org/html/2411.01992 the paper "mitigating a discrete sign problem" https://arxiv.org/html/2312.12636v1 and the paper  so can you please give me a start for Coq, Agda and Lean4 formalizations by providing initial directory structures, starter code with parsable placeholders such as `admit` and `sorry` for gaps, context, APIs, and documentation that can be copied into every chat that is long enough to contain all the meaningful information such as ideas for consistent and coherent formalization of the entire thing that compiles, with per-directory context and APIs provided in later chats, but which fits in the 128k-token context window while leaving space for the formalization, with compactification by defining prompt Turing machines, neural field Turing machines and proving that they are equivalent directly to each other instead of through normal Turing machines if possible to make it shorter?
