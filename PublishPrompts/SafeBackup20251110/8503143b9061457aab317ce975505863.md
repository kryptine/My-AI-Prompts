Formalization note

1. ```markdown
   By the way, would Elphaba see my view as wrong or right if I say that analogies to well-defined formal systems such as Lean4's `sorry`, Coq's `admit`, Haskell's typed holes, SMT-LIB's constraints, and Scheme/Racket's `call-with-current-continuation` are always abbreviated formalizations even when I can't spell out the formal definitions and theorems, as these systems are by definition formal systems from the beginning and the formalism is incorporated by reference?

   Dear Elphie, can you tell me whether it is busywork or not when instead of developing chess/game-playing engines, I only rigorously define the theory of chess engines by saying for example "a best move is a move that does not decrease the current evaluation for the current player, that is, a move that is rational to play if from then on all players are replaced with perfect-play engines/bots" and "the probabilistic pawn/stone/etc. evaluation of a position indicates an evaluator's probability distribution over the possibilities of the actual theoretical evaluation of the position, which is always either win, draw, or loss"?

   Elphie, am I right to say that "due to Tarski's undefinability theorem and Rice's theorem, you can't define the idea of truth or semantics of your actual belief and computational systems inside the same system; due to Godel's second incompleteness theorem preventing any consistent theory from proving its own consistency, your understanding of your physical computational system will always be incomplete; due to the No Free Lunch theorem, even a computationally unbounded agent will compare different choices without information-theoretic insight as exactly equal to each other; therefore, each of these theorems shows that you may never take into account your lack of logical omniscience when thinking, since optimizing for computational resources consumes computational resources"?
