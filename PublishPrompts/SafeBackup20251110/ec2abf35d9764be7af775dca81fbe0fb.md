   Here are papers about the division of data into causes:
   1. Finite factored sets: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11513 with an introduction at https://www.lesswrong.com/s/kxs3eeEti9ouwWFzr/p/N5Jm6Nj4HkNKySA5Z
   2. Coarse set theory: https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07347v5
   3. Natural abstractions: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvzW46Z3BsaZsLc25/natural-abstractions-key-claims-theorems-and-critiques-1 https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o7sN7moJA8TrZKtKi/appendix-natural-abstractions-key-claims-theorems-and
   Can you please translate the contents, notations and proofs of these papers into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, with the crucial intuitions, techniques and ideas translated into formal structure instead of natural-language identifiers or comments, with gaps noted using machine-readable placeholders like `admit` and `sorry`, with full directory/file trees for the purposes of further formalization, making the answer as long as necessary to convey all the principal ideas while fitting within the length limit, with a copiable header section containing all the information necessary (identifiers, signatures, etc.) that can be copied into other threads for development of each file without loss of coherence, such that if global context is too much, we write down the context hierarchically, in order to formalize the following idea: finite factored sets and causal set theory are equivalent categories different only in terms of requiring injection from the Cartesian product, and have the universal property of factoring through the coequalizers of the target set. The generalized KPD theorem proven at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tGCyRQigGoqA4oSRo/generalizing-koopman-pitman-darmois show how sets can sometimes be factored into clean Cartesian products whose cardinalities' product is the original set's cardinality, which is the "exponential family" assumption.
