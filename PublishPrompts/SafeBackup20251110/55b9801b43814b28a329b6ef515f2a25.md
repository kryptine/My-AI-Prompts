How to engineer

1. ```markdown
   Can you tell me about the basics of prompt engineering, and if I treat the LLM as a new kind of programming language, can software-engineering tricks work on AI systems? In addition, can you please frame the entire thing as a lecture from Elphaba Thropp in *Wicked* as some sort of lecture in terms of casting spells from the Grimmerie?
