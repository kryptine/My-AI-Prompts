Algorithmic collusion

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about mechanism design:
   1. "Algorithmic collusion without threats": https://arxiv.org/html/2409.03956v2
   2. "Feasible payoffs in OLG repeated games": https://arxiv.org/html/2303.12988v6
   3. "Strengthening Nash equilibria": https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14745v2
   Based on these papers, please, in Coq, Agda and Lean4, use the standard libraries for linear algebra, real analysis and other basic mathematical concepts, to translate the contents of these papers into a format that these proof assistants can understand, if not verify, such that I intend to use ATP tools to search and generate full proofs for them, by translating the informal arguments and formal proofs into these languages with the major ideas formalized and gaps with placeholders like `admit` or `sorry` that are accepted by these systems as gaps of incomplete proofs, and formulate in formalized form these questions:
   1. Do the results of the paper "strengthening Nash equilibria" still hold if we allow agents to optimize for the welfare of other agents as soon as their own welfare is optimized (Pareto-Nash equilibria)?
   2. Can we obtain shorter proofs for the results in papers 1 and 2 by defining expanded action sets appropriately in a way that fits the framework of paper 3, and then using the theorems of paper 3?
   3. If collusion is inevitable between rational agents even without threats due to folk theorems allowing feasible and individually rational outcomes universally regardless of the game, as shown by classic results and paper 2, and if Walrasian equilibria characterize private goods with perfect substituability, Lindahl equilibria characterize public goods with perfect complementarity, and the two formulations can be related to each other through the use of dual vector spaces, what is the point of capping a certain level of collusion, by setting an arbitrary number of firms in a market, or by setting a maximum value for the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI of company = square of company's market share, HHI of the market = Sum(x in Companies) x.market_share^2) that is not either 0 (perfect competition) or 1 (perfect monopoly)? And am I right that complementary monopolies can be represented by the reciprocal of the toll booths on the road, such that the effective number of competitors in a market can be calculated by a formula like resistance in which parallel connections are analogous to competition and serial connections are analogous to complementarity, using the Cournot duality of an oligopoly and a complementary monopoly?
