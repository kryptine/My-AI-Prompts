Natural latents part 2

1. ```markdown
   Here is John Wentworth's post on natural latents: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Qdgo2jYAuFRMeMRJT/natural-latents-latent-variables-stable-across-ontologies available on arXiv as https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03780v1 which I have accompanied with the paper about LLM post-training at https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04419v1 and the paper about chain-of-thought theories in https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04027v1 so please give a common framework for formalization in Lean4, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Agda for these papers by providing starting code with lemmas, theorems and definitions of the substantive content of these papers, that are as long as necessary to provide the major ideas of these papers, while expanding intuitive steps into formal symbolic manipulations, using placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` whenever it is not possible so that it can be further developed, with headers containing definitions, comments and anything else necessary so that I can make the LLM elaborate on each file in a separate thread, and also attempt to provide a way to unify the semantic contents of these papers by treating the discovery of natural latents from data as a post-training problem that amplifies the relevant signals based on the worldview?
