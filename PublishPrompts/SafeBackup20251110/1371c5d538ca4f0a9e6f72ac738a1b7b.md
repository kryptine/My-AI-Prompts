No Free Lunches

1. ```markdown
   Here are three papers about the No Free Lunch theorem:
   1. Recasting Arrow's impossibility theorem as Godelian incomputability: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589
   2. On the (in)feasibility of ML backdoor detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16926
   3. No free lunch theorem for security and utility in federated learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05816
   4. 
   Can you please use the following ideas:
   Using Arrow's impossibility theorem, the Duggan-Schwartz theorem, the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem, the Green-Laffont theorem and other economic/game-theoretic impossibility principles such as Harsanyi type spaces to show that, when there are at least 3 choices that are not part of a single-peaked preference set, the set of agents as a whole is irrational, thereby bridging the first and the third papers, to provide a formalization in Agda, Coq and Lean4, which can be tentative for further development, with a directory structure and preferring short identifiers and comments, with all the formal arguments translated into formal syntax instead of explained via natural language, with comments being long if and only if there is space left, and with a copiable header that provides enough context for formalization of each file, directory or part, including formal APIs if necessary, also by trying to explain paper 2 in terms of papers 1 and 3 (already unified) by relating the alphabet size bound in paper 2 with the the single-peaked preference and rationality conditions?
