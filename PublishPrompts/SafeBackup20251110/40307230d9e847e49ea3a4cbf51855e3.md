Program equilibrium

1. ```markdown
   Can you please start formalizing as far as you can the results of these papers in Coq (Rocq), Agda, and Lean https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-018-9679-3 and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14570, in particular showing how the two papers prove theorems about the epsilon-grounded-pi-bot, and tell me how to extend the results of the first paper to games with three or more players by making each player a_i treat the rest of the world (the remaining players a_-i) as a single agent whose utilities are added, multiplied, or otherwise monotonically combined together, then using simulations or other methods as tiebreaking when actions differ only in how they distribute the benefits of cooperation or the harms of defection, that is, while choosing between Kaldor-Hicks equivalent choices for other agents, in accordance to von Neumann's original framework of proving game-theoretic equilibria for only two-player games, and the base combinatorial argument of Sperner's lemma used to prove Brouwer's fixed-point theorem? In addition, can you show how the common knowledge of the exact random numbers is necessary by literally formalizing the proofs in Lean, Rocq and Agda and show how the arguments here are similar to the proofs of non-exclusivity of information in virtual implementation, the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem and Aumann's agreement theorem?
