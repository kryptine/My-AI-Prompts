   Write a position paper, ready for arXiv and other ML conferences, in compliant LaTeX, wrapped in backticks for Markdown or any other method of code transclusion for your native output format, with the following summary: Given that Cybenko's universal approximation theorem shows that nearly any nonlinear activation function can be composed to approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, and that the same fact of a single simple element being combinable to approximate anything being also present in the Reeh-Schlieder theorem (vacuum operator => arbitrary states in Hilbert spaces), the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem (the basis of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks), Fourier's theorem for spectral transforms (any periodic waveform can be composed to approximate any wave according to transforms by Fourier, Laplace, Hartley, etc.), analytic continuations and holomorphic functions, the Yoneda lemma, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem, the enumerability of universal Turing machines by checking for universality of instruction sets, the enumerability of fixed-point combinators, universal grammars, etc. as well as the development of theories such as reservoir computing, described at https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02639v1 https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12382v2 the next step in AI development is the use of LLMs to develop even more efficient AI systems.
