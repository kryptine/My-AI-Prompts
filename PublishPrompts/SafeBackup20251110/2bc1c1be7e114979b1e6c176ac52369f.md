Language model hallucinations

1. ```markdown
   Here is OpenAI's paper "Why language models hallucinate": https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/ together with the paper "Mission impossible" at https://arxiv.org/html/2408.01420v1 and the "poison once, refuse forever" paper at https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333?context=cs.DC so can you please use the do-divergence theorem at https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/DHSY697pRWYto6LsF/do-divergence-a-bound-for-maxwell-s-demon as well as the probabilistic Payor's lemma at https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wmJT2j3rdT8ngFkPN/self-referential-probabilistic-logic-admits-the-payor-s to construct unifying frameworks for formalization of these theorems in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 with full directory structures, imports for standard concepts, definitions, theorems, lemmas and proofs as a starting point for further formalization with LLMs in separate threads by converting as much intuitive and formal details of these papers and posts into these programming/proving languages as possible, with placeholders for vagueness or length like `admit` and `sorry` that can be parsed and compiled as incompleteness instead of errors, and with a separate header in a box that can be copied into separate threads to provide the full context including the signatures, meaning and formal bindings so that each file or each part can be formalized using LLMs with small context windows without loss of coherence?
