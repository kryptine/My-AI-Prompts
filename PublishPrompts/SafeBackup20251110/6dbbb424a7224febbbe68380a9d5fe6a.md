   Here are a few papers:
   1. Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed? https://arxiv.org/html/2411.08003v3
   2. Mission Impossible: A Statistical Perspective on Jailbreaking LLMs https://arxiv.org/html/2408.01420v1
   3. (Im)possibility of Automated Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models https://arxiv.org/html/2504.17004v2
   4. On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models https://arxiv.org/html/2506.06382v5
   Can you start formalizing the statements, lemmas and theorems in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, taking into account the fact that papers 1 and 3 share the theory of Angluin language discrimination and other similar formalisms, papers 3 and 4 both formalize the impossibility of hallucination detection and control, papers 2 and 4 both use statistical frameworks for the impossibility of aligning AIs to prevent misbehavior, and papers 1 and 2 both show the impossibility of preventing misuse, to define file/directory structures, type signatures, axioms, theorems, and proof sketches with gaps denoted by `admit` and `sorry`, so as not to exceed the context window limit of this model, by writing the code, files and directories within 82k tokens, with 16k tokens being  dedicated to the header/preamble, which will provide context for AIs or humans developing each part by copy-pasting the header and the subproject for each part, in a verifiable way in the colimit/co-Yoneda lemma sense in category theory, by analogy with the Turing machine's "context window" as the current tape position and a finite state machine and sheaves forming a global section in topology?
