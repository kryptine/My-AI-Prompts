Differential privacy

1. ```markdown
   Here are two papers about differential privacy:
   1. Efficient noise generation for differential privacy: https://arxiv.org/html/2404.16706v3
   2. A statistical viewpoint on differential privacy: https://arxiv.org/html/2409.09558v2
   Can you please translate this framework to Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, so that standard libraries are used for concepts like real numbers, probabilities and linear algebra, with gaps shown as `admit`, `sorry` and other placeholders for further development using automated theorem provers and proof searches, but making the formalizations as long as possible to fit within a single answer, so that it can replicate as many points from the original papers as possible but nothing extra for further development, and can you tell me, whether the definitions of differential privacy listed here violate the preconditions of the envelope theorem in economics and optimization theory by coupling the dimensions with privacy constraints on action, resulting in Myerson-Satterthwaite impossibility according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_theorem?
