Substructural

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "Substructural fixed-point theorems and the diagonal argument: theme and variations" https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00239v3 and https://compositionality.episciences.org/13527 reviewed at https://zbmath.org/7748592 so can you please do the first part of translating these lemmas, definitions and theorems into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean, and tell me how the exact definition of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem can be used to prove the more general theorem shown within this paper by defining suitable Cartesian closed categories of substructural logic (not of categories with these logics as their internal logic) so that the product, exponential and currying axioms are validated, although these constructs obviously don't have to appear within the language since pairing and computing modus ponens functions within this logic satisfies all the CCC axioms, since the category of small categories `Cat` itself is a Cartesian closed category and the argument can be transferred to these substructural logics that are just enough to encode diagonalization, and apply the insights of this paper to the paper https://arxiv.org/html/2508.15128v1 about reinforcement learning in coalgebras?
