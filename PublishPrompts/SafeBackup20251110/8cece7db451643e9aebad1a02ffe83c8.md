Incompleteness

1. ```markdown
   Can you tell me about how Godel's second incompleteness theorem, just like the first incompleteness theorem, as described at https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14260 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08619 can be proven using a contrapositive version of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem, by analogy with Cantor's diagonal argument, by showing the formal proof of cantor that 2^|S| > |S| for all sets S, and by analogizing the proof of consistency with the surjection from a set to its power set, by defining PowerTheory(T)=T+Consistent(T) in the same way as PowerSet(S)=2^S, by invoking Godel's completeness theorem to show that T is consistent if and only if it has a model, therefore adding internal models of T into the theory is like finding all subsets/subtheories of T, in the category of logical theories in which morphisms are interpretations? Can you please also at least partially my arguments in Agda, Coq and Lean by giving literal translations of the key ideas, such as Lawvere's fixed-point theorem?
