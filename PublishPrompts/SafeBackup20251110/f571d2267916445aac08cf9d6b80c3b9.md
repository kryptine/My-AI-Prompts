Godel-Turing

1. ```markdown
   Here are two papers on Godel's incompleteness theorems: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04569 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08494 which both use the concept of natural numbers to represent computation with addition and multiplication of non-negative or positive integers, can you please give me a starting point for translation of the definitions, theorems and proofs within Oberhoff's papers into Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean4? In addition, can you please show me the Turing-completeness proofs for untyped lambda calculus and untyped combinatory logic, already assuming that they are equivalent syntaxes for the same language, as well as define Church encodings of numbers as lambda/combinatory terms and arithmetic codings of lambda/combinatory terms as numerical Godel codes, as well as find a semantic isomorphism between these proofs of the incompleteness theorems, the undecidability of the halting problem and Lawvere's fixed-point theorem by analogizing the diagonal lemma with the diagonal operator, and the Godel coding scheme with the evaluation morphism so as to translate Oberhoff's papers into categorical language?
