Good regulator theorem

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper "Robust agents learn causal models" at https://arxiv.org/html/2402.10877 and here are pages about the Good Regulator theorem at https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Dx9LoqsEh3gHNJMDk/fixing-the-good-regulator-theorem https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Rwjrrmn6LBzHrfen7/an-illustrated-summary-of-robust-agents-learn-causal-world and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YEnTGLBu2crDw5GFo/a-generalization-of-the-good-regulator-theorem so can you translate the main contents, theorems and proofs of these pages into Agda, Lean4 and Rocq (formerly Coq) in the most straightforward way possible, assuming that standard concepts such as real numbers are defined in the standard libraries, by defining probability distributions/functionals, entropy, utility/loss functions over reals, and by encoding control-theoretic diagrams, because I prefer the linear notation of theorem provers, and also as a starting point for automated theorem proving, in which you don't need to generate the entire proofs, just the main intuitions, letting the provers themselves such as SMT-LIB solvers generate and verify the rest?
