   Here is the introduction to logical induction for software engineers, whose code is at https://github.com/monasticacademy/logical-induction/raw/refs/heads/master/logicalinduction/enumerator.py https://github.com/monasticacademy/logical-induction/raw/refs/heads/master/logicalinduction/sentence.py https://github.com/monasticacademy/logical-induction/raw/refs/heads/master/logicalinduction/inductor.py and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monasticacademy/logical-induction/refs/heads/master/logicalinduction/inductor_test.py and text is at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5GftLezdozEHdXkL/an-intuitive-guide-to-garrabrant-induction so can you please compare the formalisms of Garrabrant's logical induction with the formalism for inter-agent alignment at https://arxiv.org/html/2502.05934v2 by translation of the algorithms within the two systems, including the pseudocode in the paper and the Python code in the notebook above, into Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 by using standard libraries for real numbers and other standard concepts and matching the spirit of the original source code line-by-line, to make the translation as long as necessary to match the original algorithms, propositions and proofs, and can you please analogically compare the "Bayesian wannabes" with the "logical inductors" to show that the exponential bound for convergence of Bayesian wannabes are analogous to the running time of the logical inductors, based on the logical bounds, as well as compare the "Dutch book" arguments to the "no free lunch"/"Aumann agreement" proofs for the AI alignment paper?
