   Can you please show me various proofs of Sperner's lemma, a graph-theoretic theorem important in proving Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, by formalization in Agda, Coq and Lean? In addition, can you please also formalize various folk theorems using limits-of-means and overtaking criteria, for subgame-perfect and coalition-proof equilibria?

   What I mean is, can you spell out the statements and proofs of these theorems I mentioned literally into Agda, Coq and Lean by literal translation based on natural-language sources, as a demonstration of the ideas and a starting point for independent development?
