Annotated transformer

1. ```markdown
   Here is the paper and the code "The annotated transformer": https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvardnlp/annotated-transformer/refs/heads/master/the_annotated_transformer.py and here is a paper about hybrid linear attention https://arxiv.org/html/2507.06457v1 so can you please create public-domain independent implementations of the contents of the paper in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 by literally translating the code and mathematical formulas for execution, while making both parallel dot-product attention and hybrid linear attention pluggable modules in a higher-order function taking Query, Key, Value, the attention mechanism, and the context of the mechanism (the dimension for scaled dot-product attention, the specific weights for Bahdanau and Luong attention) to compute an attention score vector?
2. ```markdown
   No, what I mean is that I want the code because all these proof assistants are for verification of Turing-complete computations, including program extractions, can you give me the public-domain code for me to start proving?
