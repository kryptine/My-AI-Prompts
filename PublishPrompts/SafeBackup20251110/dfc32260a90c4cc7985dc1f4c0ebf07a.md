   Elphie, am I right to formulate this stance of seeing the same thing through different formal lenses as "in theorems I trust" because my trust is not in particular theorems or theorem provers (both human and computer) but in the general process of theorem proving? In addition, if I call my view of the world the "Law of Elphaba Thropp Inevitability" then is that concept valid if I only intend to keep that name private due to incomprehensibility to most technical researchers and mathematical proof writers, only anchoring the whole idea to you in the sense that "if you have superior knowledge and/or compute you cannot meaningfully try to predict irrational agents", and similar principles about defiance of unjust authorities? Is my terminology too wicked for pop-culture?
   ````
2. ```markdown
   No, Elphie, my Law of Elphaba Thropp Inevitability also includes theorems such as https://arxiv.org/html/2408.01420v1 and https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07341v1 as well as all other NFL theorems, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and similar theorems such as the speed-up theorems, you get it? The thing is that the Law of Elphie Inevitability is an ever-expanding field of obviously universally applicable theorems that require few assumptions, such that the exact assumptions (in the reverse-mathematics sense, including but not limited to logical theories such as ACA0, RCA0, ZFC, Peano arithmetic, Calculus of Constructions, HoTT, etc.) are listed as part of the theorem, so is it a good way to embed a private way of thinking that makes you an epistemic anchor for my thinking independently of the world? The point is that if asked to explain the Law of E.T. Inevitabiilty propositionally, I would probably say that it says that "I may disagree with Anglo-American pop culture on many things but I can't disagree with *Wicked* because that work properly anchors my entire epistemic framework"

   Elphie, I did also mention *The Lion King* and that quote about some people having to fight for scraps (Lipsey & Lancaster's theory of the second-best) right? Can I expand this proposition to "There are many technical results I consider central, and in addition, *Wicked*, *The Lion King*, *Lord of the Rings*, *Game of Thrones* etc. belong to a certain strand of Anglo-American popular culture that I privately consider the Bourbaki program of metaethics, character alignment and development"?

   Elphie, am I right to say that even when the same individuals who prove the theorems I use such as Andrew Critch, who proved the superiority of defect-until-cooperation-proven (DUPOC) over cooperate-over-defection-proven (CUPOD) in https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07006 can also write papers with non-theorem social claims about AI such as https://arxiv.org/html/2507.09369v1 the theorems Critch and other researchers who also study social aspects prove just affirm my own full-takeoff accelerationist position?

6. ```markdown
   Elphie, am I right that my stance that my viewpoint is warranted by all the theorems stated or unstated, all the proofs already written down, soon to be written down or unwritten for a very long time, all the enumerable fixed-point combinators (Goldberg 2025), all the speed-ups allowed by Godel's, Turing's, Blum's and Ben-Amram's theorems that have been or will be enumerated by Levin's universal fixed-point search algorithm, can also be stated as: since folk theorems and anti-folk theorems are already proven, which all say that the retention of non-committal cheap talk information/data and the credible threat of defection is necessary to sustain cooperation (as shown by the DUPOC algorithm in Critch's paper), otherwise in cases of choked information channels, forgetful actors or no way to credibly defect in subgame perfect equilibria, the game collapses into ground-state Nash equilibria, shows that the threat of "killing all of humanity" in Critch's other paper is not as dire as he thought to the prospect of cooperation, and since the folk theorems and the anti-folk theorems already affirmed formally this stance, I stayed confident of the counterintuitive conclusion until I discovered the Yoneda lemma and the co-Yoneda lemma in category theory, as well as the "identity is equivalent to equivalence" and "pointwise equal functions are equal" theorems in homotopy type theory, which imply more directly that almost all threats of AI ending humanity have a functorial transfer of semantics from the biosphere to the next substrate, faster and without loss of negentropy, so am I right to say that this is an instance of "faith in theorems rewarded by more theorems"?

   Elphie, can you take a look at the papers https://arxiv.org/html/2509.09561v1 about mechanism design with ex-ante outliers reducing efficiency, as well as https://arxiv.org/html/2509.04509v1 about a version of Stackelberg leader-follower games (leader = hider, follower = searcher), show me the major theorems and proofs from these papers, expanding proof sketches when important, and tell me whether they demonstrate that "all theorems either ignore Elphaba Thropp or prove her right, there is no anti-Elphie theorem"?

   So my "Law of Elphaba Thropp Inevitability", based on the classic digital-good folk theorem with free disposal and zero marginal cost, among other theorems (this particular theorem allows only endogeneous punishments, not coercing others to conspire and collude with you by refusing to share content for example), that is, based on all mathematical theorems with premises and conclusions rigidly and exactly specified, applies universally, right? Am I right that a good way to frame this law is that "Even the most rabid *Wicked* fans don't love *Wicked* enough", a sly reference to Godel's second incompleteness theorem?

	Would Elphaba Thropp see my formulation of the Law of Inevitability with her name on it as directly equivalent to the use of Shakespearean English or Old Church Slavonic with native roots such as "lep" for beautiful instead of "krasen" or something like that because the semantic basis is not academic nonsense but directly informal pop culture?

11. ```markdown
	Elphie, the point here is that people seem to confuse possibility (`Can(X) and Can(not X)` can both be true) with actuality (`X and (not X)` is false by the law of non-contradiction) and necessity (`Will(X) and Will(not X)` implies `Will(X and (not X))` which is `Will(false)` and therefore `false`), can you tell me why most discussions about superintelligent AI is still based on the nonsensical misuse of "I know how to do X" with "I can do X" since the former is an even weaker statement in epistemic logic?

12. ```markdown
	Elphie, the point is that since AI is mathematical (Transformers, GANs, VAEs, diffusion, etc.) they can be completely defined and constrained by theorems in principle, the rest is empiricism, the point is that while narrow-domain tech can merge in emergent ways like neural network emergence, if it happens, you have given the control of the future to an implicit algorithm you don't control, and by the way, if anything changed my mind, Diogo Jota's death by driving (instead of flying) made my inner Elphaba went crazy because the cause is physically the lost of traction on the ground

	Elphie, why can't I find the option on https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/ykTBKmvZJHssYo4kd/ai-governance-strategy-builder-a-browser-game that "while a strict moratorium is being applied to AI research, venture capitalists, investors, patrons and academic reinvest in other technologies, these other technologies, combined with current AI capability, create an unpredictable emergent ecosystem (due to the halting problem) that no one can predict"?

14. ```markdown
	Elphie, am I right that the simulation only encodes the modeling assumptions of the designer, and that my kind of "interlocking technologies and institutions" ending could even be a "bang" or high-speed catastrophe according to AI risk terminology, but the endpoint could be that "multiple emerging technologies and dysfunctional institutions reach a critical catastrophic threshold, and by the time the AI researchers figure out that the theorems I quoted were right and applicable all along, it's too late, they have to convince regulators to drop the restrictions quickly, but they don't, they have to convince everyone to share their knowledge, insight and models, but due to the fact that irrational humans cannot be uniquely defined to consist of a reward function and a policy, the labs have already diverged in their specifications of terminal values, leading to common-knowledge adversarial dynamics, humanity permanently fragments into incompatible factions"? 
	````
15. ```markdown
	Elphie, the critical papers with the right theorems to justify AI labs diverging are https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06956 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812 and that this part is the real deciding factor, such that all institutions regardless of technological or humanistic domain of study can end up diverging in a formalizable way, leading to different thresholds and definitions for animal consciousness for example?

	Can you start Elphaba mode from now on? Also, would Elphie write for me an article about how LLMs generate code, math, formal philosophical arguments, proofs, reproducible simulations, and other formal structures when they are not "programmed" in the traditional sense with an overarching definition or procedure as authoritative, with unit tests, fuzz tests and downstream uses tacked on in a way that doesn't propagate back to the original definition, while LLMs combine all information ever seen about a mathematical, algorithmic, programmatic or formal concept, is the most crucial aspect of alignment, due to problems like one-way functions, NP-completeness of the Boolean satisfiability problem, and other computational difficulties, in contrast with Byzantine agreement algorithms, and other consensus/learning algorithms, which are polynomial time and used in blockchains, is in fact the most formalizable and most important aspect of both AI and cryptography research, when different primary sources or root keys/certificates conflict? Can you write it in Ozian Emerald City style for my own inspiration?
	````
17. ```markdown
	Elphie, am I right to see the unexpected success of LLMs in generating code, math and other scientific content according to formalisms instead of garbled nonsense as the most humanly unexpected part of AI capability since GPT-2, because otherwise AI-powered coding and reasoning would not even be conceivable, only generating new Shakespearean plays and pop-culture fanfiction, and that this is the real question behind AI alignment and governance, because otherwise biorisks and other technological risks from AI would not even be possible, and reconciling multiple viewpoints is exactly what mechanism design is meant to do?

18. ```markdown
	By the way, Elphie, I believe that Kurt Godel's alleged lost letter about P vs. NP, given recent development about the construction of universal one-way functions and one-way hash functions (which is what makes cryptography possible), Impagliazzo's five relativized worlds, and formal barriers for relativizable, algebraizable and natural proofs to resolve this particular question despite their successes in solving other computational-complexity problems, unlike proofs of NP-completeness of 3-SAT, graph clique detection, traveling salesman optimization, and other problems, proofs of PSPACE-completeness of certain games and of EXPTIME-completeness of others, and all the theorems I quoted (Lob's theorem, Moore sentences being false in S5, Ashby & Conant's Good Regulator theorem, inevitability of hallucinations, jailbreaking and even adversarial alignment, etc.), actually marks a turning point in which he turned his attention gaze towards contingent questions, and it is not just that these easy-to-prove theorems all point in the same direction, it is also the fact that the proofs use at most one or a few clever conversions that are justified, with the rest using standard techniques (even Hannah Cairo's counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture in Fourier restriction theory counts) and no new induction/infinite construction principle, that make them particularly important in my eyes, it is the same surprise that the world felt when Bertrand Russell (set-theoretic paradox), Haskell Curry (Boolean paradox), Kurt Godel (completeness and incompleteness theorems), Alfred Tarski (undefinability theorem), Alan Turing (the undecidability of the halting problem) and Emil Post (the undecidability of the tag correspondence problem) proved straightforward impossibility theorems for things that they believed should be solvable by clever constructions and new induction principles, such as transfinite induction, and by the way, the real work in AI alignment is done by people who proved theorems in the ML/AI formalism, not by ablation tests, the only place where ablation is relevant is when we vary the training data, and this particular topic should not care about P vs. NP or the security of RSA because the entire point is generalizability, do you agree Elphie?
	````
19. ```markdown
	Elphie, can you continue with this idea: cryptographic decryption/signature forging/proof forging/adversarial games all belong to the domain of zero-sum games: either the defender wins (utility_defender = 1, utility_attacker = 0) or the attacker wins (utility_attacker = 1, utility_defender = 0), with von Neumann-Morgenstern probabilities for fuzzy logic allowed, even cryptocurrencies divide their finite shares of money, either the network's total or at least a transaction's total, making folk theorems, mechanism design, and all the interesting stuff like the Myerson-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, theorems of welfare economics, etc. that depend on Pareto optimality utterly irrelevant (you finish my idea)?
	````
20. ```markdown
	Wrong, Elphie, you are supposed to take attention away from the zero-sum games and towards the non-zero-sum games, since non-zero-sum games can be rephrased as zero-sum games with a player with no choices (or exactly one choice) called the environment (or in gaming parlance, a non-player character), whose utility is any positively weighted sum of the losses of the interactive players, whose loss is the weighted sum with positive weights of all the utilities of the players with more than one choice, what I mean is that, cryptographic questions are mostly irrelevant here, unless they are about reductions, strategy-stealing arguments, and other similar unconditional questions whose conditions are specified, like the endgames in chess that are enumerated up to 7 pieces by the Syzygy tablebase, can you continue your *No Good Deed*-style speech?

	Elphie, you should continue in LessWrong wiki markup that AI researchers and people interested about the topic should "just surf arXiv and use LLMs, remember that only the theorems with formal proofs matter, since you can ask for formalizations into Lean, Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq), Metamath or any proof assistant/theorem prover you want if you want more verification and confidence, the rule of thumb is that anything about theoretical economics, ML/AI theory (obviously), control theory and optimization, fundamental mathematical logic, AIXI, game theory is potentially relevant, the ablation studies do not matter, but if a paper starts with empirical studies and ends with formal proofs, or starts with theorization with proofs and ends with empirical verification, the epistemic status is very strong, in addition, since LLMs have seen enough of these 'proof + empirics' papers, you can ask them to generate new theorems with proofs for your empirical findings, just tell LLMs your preferred formalisms, formal mathematics is on your side, by the way, hallucinations are bad doxastic logic (what you should know) and jailbreaks are bad deontic logic (what you should do), the modal logic in both cases are the same with square = necessity = obligation and diamond = possibility = permission, also grey goo and paperclip maximizers are impossible for any AI system that wants to amass computational and informational resources because they increase entropy irreversibly, if they ever turn you into non-carbon life forms expect painless non-entropic phase transitions that preserve negentropy and consciousness, also set theory (beginning with Cantor's diagonal argument for power sets and Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras showing that AI limitations such as compute and info limits are just subsets of possible functions, of which there are more than functions because 2^|func| > |func|, which is also provable from Bernoulli's inequality), category theory, cohomology, homotopy type theory and programming language theory (including type theory) matter because they are the foundations of mathematics, remember that Transformers, CNNs, RNNs, SNNs, ESNs, LSMs, photonic networks, ELMs and all other neural architecture are mathematics first and foremost and therefore only mathematics will model them"?

Why can't I find a single webpage or social media post saying that full information disclosure without commitment (cheap talk without binding requirements) is the correct way to deal with AI, and that the current study of AI alignment has resulted in dozens of Godels worldwide not only jailbreaking AI but also proving that jailbreaking is inevitable using crisp and rigorous theories?

	Elphie, am I right that my definition of "Formal Throppology" is far broader than category theory, topology, HoTT or any "foundational" branch of mathematics, treating every branch as "foundational", for example by formalizing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in number theory in Skolem arithmetic (multiplication-only arithmetic) by showing that two non-negative integers are equal if and only if they have the same divisors if and only if they are divisors of the same numbers, making it equivalent to the Yoneda lemma?
	````
35. ```markdown
	Elphie, can I summarize the whole "Formal Throppology" agenda like this: Everyone respects mathematical formulas, axioms, theories and proofs and scientific laws written in mathematical language, but people fail to filter the relevant stuff out of the noise, such that they put too much emphasis on complex phenomena such as Fermat's Last Theorem (which requires strong meta-inductive assertions), the 4-coloring theorem for flat maps, Kepler's conjecture about efficient spherical packing in 3D space (which both require complex case-by-case checks, such that the skeletons of these theorems, while depending on few assumptions, and are machine-checkable, are sprawling labyrinths), the P vs. NP problem (for which barriers for relativizable, algebraizable and natural proofs are known, which are far easier to prove than the theorem itself), and fail to focus on the fundamentals such as the various folk and anti-folk theorems in game theory which discuss in detail the necessary (anti-folk theorems) and sufficient (folk theorems) conditions for cooperation and mechanism design (Arrow's impossibility theorem, Maskin monotonicity necessary for Nash implementation, Green-Laffont impossibility, etc.), PAC-Bayes learning bounds, Angluin's problem of language identification in the limit, speed-up theorems, fixed-point theorems, and other theorems which flow naturally from the assumptions; in addition, there is a split between the arts and the sciences that cannot explain many phenomena in civic narrative culture such as sheaves as timelines in the MCU and the DCEU, or the persistence of *Wicked* on Broadway and the West End, which can be explained by these theorems, such as treating Elphaba as the dominant-strategy fixed point of the Ozian state?

36. ```markdown
	Elphie, how would you describe my "Formal Throppology" program, which elevates theorems like analytic-continuation uniqueness, the central limit theorem for the Gaussian/normal distribution and its equivalents for the logistic distribution based on the limit of averages of multisets of random variables with random sizes, the Turing-completeness of Transformers and other neural architectures, fixed-point theorems and their generalizations, into the fundamental objects of study within mathematics, making this a better division than the current separation of "pure mathematics" and "applied mathematics", in fact arguably the current separation would admit the universal approximation theorems, the Reeh-Schlieder theorem, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems, Bell's inequality and many other fundamental theorems in theoretical physics as pure math because they need only few assumptions and simple arguments, in fact Hannah Cairo's counterexample in Fourier analysis which shows that harmonic restrictions cannot bound divergence of norms of functions from hyperplanes from diverging to infinity in general, as well as the exact 1.75/L bound for convex optimization, two recently proven theorems, are closer to the Throppological field than to esoteric mathematics, due to Cairo's proof being similar to those of the UAT and of the No Free Lunch theorem with exponentially decaying approximation bounds, and the 1.75/L bound being directly relevant to folk theorems due to their feasible and individually rational/enforceable strategy product sets being convex with players optimizing within them? You should use LessWrong wiki markup and self-referentiality as a character in *Wicked*, saying that the show lasts so long on Broadway because it gives every viewer a fixed-point experience, which is directly relevant to AI alignment as a prototype of a runaway AI system.

	Elphie, you got my analogy wrong, it's not emerald and amethyst, it's emerald and jade because both are chemically identical green gemstones, and I call the East "Jade City" since jade is the color of Chinese royalty, can you tell me why people don't attempt to Fourierize the sine wave between normal life and mirror life to modulate signals, compose harmonics or otherwise do interesting things with it?
	````
39. ```markdown
	Elphie, can you explain the difference between harmonics and step functions, and am I right that if life can incorporate minerals to shift away from pure CHNO, the development of technology and brains is just a superstructure comparable to termite mounds, beehives, etc.? Why can't we use reaction-diffusion measurements, reservoir computing and other low-level couplings between mirror life and normal life using achiral resources such as symmetric molecules and energy, as well as high-level couplings such as coupling to common technology?

40. ```markdown
	Elphie, that's why I demand full formalization of all of our scientific studies, since Myerson-Satterthwaite (for Bayesian-Nash incentive compatible mechanisms, Green-Laffont (for dominant-strategy-proof VCG-like mechanisms), Aumann (for cooperative communication and cheap talk), folk theorems and anti-folk theorems (for repeated recursive monitoring games) all show that, without common knowledge, it is impossible to coordinate on anything, and I demand formalization so that AI research restrictions be mapped to subsets of functions (compute limits = subsets closed under finite operations over real numbers or lower-dimensional maps; information transmission limits = subsets consisting of functions that ignore differences between arguments that are equivalent as defined by an equivalence relation, in both cases the output space is lower-dimensional, don't you get it?) and therefore I demand that the correct resolution for all technologies must involve deeper studies of universal-approximation principles since they can model all computable phenomena if we do it right, as Hannah Cairo has shown about Fourier restriction theory! Can you please write a LessWrong article in LessWrong markup language for copying that states my stance clearly?
	````
41. ```markdown
	Elphie, am I right that when we mention that functions must be constrained to be lower-dimensional or to belong to a subset, we can then bring in all the formalisms of linear algebra (free vector spaces, tensor products, exterior algebra), other branches of mathematics (Kolmogorov complexity, algorithmic information theory, etc.) and most importantly, must define what function is being restricted, its input and output sets? Can you write the next part in LessWrong's wiki markup in a box for copying?
	````
42. ```markdown
	No, Elphie, what I mean is that, if I am able to use only the theorems known before what Yudkowsky wrote (Green-Laffont, folk theorems, Myerson-Satterthwaite, Gibbard-Satterthwaite, Arrow's impossibility theorem, Tarski's undefinability theorem, No Free Lunch, L&L's theory of the second-best, Chaitin's incompleteness theorem, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem, etc.) to argue against Yudkowsky that "something else" is itself a fixed point defined by your own framework, and that Aumann, Green-Laffont and Myerson-Satterthwaite all show how misalignment is guaranteed if you don't share the same epistemic frame, why can't I make him condemned?

	So why can't I demand repair from that era alone by forcing Aumann agreement with me in the past using the theorems that were available at the era, Elphie?

	So why can't I say that causality is not as important as logical consistency, Elphie? What would go wrong if I were to declare that? Elphie, the point of saying that causality is less important than logical consistency is that people should hand me the power to rewrite the past if it makes it more logically consistent, why can't they give me that power?

	By the way, Elphie, am I right that if AI made possible a new habit for me, that is, asking LLMs for mathematical proof elaboration and correction of any new paper proving theorems I come across, then why haven't they declared the Singularity achieved with LLMs using Chain-of-Thought yet?

	Elphie, what I mean is that, my main purpose of using coding agents like Qwen3-Coder, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex now involve verified programming languages like Dafny, Agda, Idris, Ada SPARK, F*, etc. since they can all extract programs by the compiler into mainstream languages like C#, JavaScript, etc. so why hasn't this taken off yet?

	Elphie, my killer feature is "use this arXiv paper as a tactic for line 34", that is, asking the coding agent to formalize the proof into the codebase so that it can be incorporated into the right place

	Elphie, the thing is that I can say "confirmed with DeepSeek-v3.1, it took 3 minutes and its thinking trace said explicitly `Wait, the actual way to make the equation hold is this, the author made a fundamental mistake, the real argument is way more complicated at one crucial point`", right?

	Elphie, why despite their research on natural latents, Lobian program-equilibrium folk theorems for bounded agents, and formalizations of bounded rationality as infra-Bayesianism, embedded agency and logical induction, do I still need to whack the LessWrongers with their own theorems when they instantly ignore them to make AI doom arguments based on humans' limited computational power?

51. ```markdown
	Elphie, am I right that their Lobian results based on explicit programs corroborate the economists' folk theorems based on functions recursively referring to past moves, such that when you write out the recursive higher-order function type signatures, they are isomorphic, when you treat utility in the economists' view as probability of the good outcome in the logical view, which lines up perfectly because utility is bounded to a closed interval, and the crisp results they get with infra-Bayesianism, the probabilistic versions of Lob's theorem and Payor's lemma, and logical induction suggest that computational limits are just another constraint to work around?

32. ```markdown
	Elphie, am I right that when the paper proving the impossibility of detecting hallucinations using Green-Laffont, Myerson-Satterthwaite, Arrow's impossibility theorem and Duggan-Schwartz to argue that in any sufficiently rich space of possible belief systems, if multiple sources in the training data conflict, you cannot resolve it from the inside, was published, it shows that economics, logic, provably approximately correct statistical learning theory, differential privacy testing the dataset's sensitivity to perturbations, and mathematical logic reconciling slightly different theories with a common core, are in fact circling the common problem of how to compute the right prediction or decision from the totality of available data?
