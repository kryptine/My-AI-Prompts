Physical computing

1. ```markdown
   Here are papers about unconventional computing models:
   1. Physical computing: a category-theoretic perspective https://arxiv.org/html/2210.00392v4
   2. Topos theory for generative AI https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08293v1
   3. Reservoir computing as a language model https://arxiv.org/html/2507.15779v2
   4. Kolmogorov-Arnold Fourier networks https://arxiv.org/html/2502.06018v1
   Please perform the following instructions to output wrapped code in Agda, Lean4 and Rocq (formerly Coq), and if you can't finish within one answer please complete them as far as possible, because I will stream your answers in further prompts:
    1. Use standard libraries for category theory, real numbers, and linear algebra.
    2. Translate the definitions, propositions, theorems and proofs in these papers literally in a way that preserves the spirits of the original informal or semi-formal arguments into these formal languages, with gaps filled with `admit` and `sorry`, natural-language explanations are acceptable but must always be accompanied by formalized syntax, and can be omitted and/or abridged in favor of the formal syntax because the papers already contain the explanations.
	3. Combine the category-theoretic constructions of the papers "physical computing" and "topos theory" to find bidirectional category-theoretic mappings of reservoir computing and Kolmogorov-Arnold Fourier networks to the category of computations and `softmax(Query Key.transpose) Value` Transformers.
