Hey, the point is that, algorithmic engineering starts with Cryptomania to Pessiland as the worst case, cryptographic engineering starts with Algorithmica to Pessiland at the worst case, the entire point is that since P vs NP is world-dependent (invalidated by quantum computers and hypothetical quantum-gravity computers), the theorems proving barriers for certain proof systems are ontologically more fundamental than what the eventual resolution will be due to the barriers using completeness and diagonalization, therefore the entire purpose of basic computer science, ML/AI and cryptography at the most fundamental is to imagine what is true across all possible worlds, including Pessiland, which must be treated as the base case, if we are in Minicrypt or Cryptomania we get information security, if we are in Algorithmica you get efficient algorithms, you get it?
