Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Please enumerate possible abstractions and attempt to unify the relationships between the contents of these papers by doing the following operations:
1. Apply the probabilistic Payor's lemma to robust probabilistic temporal logics.
2. Complete and formalize the proofs of Payor's lemma in K modal logic, both the syntactic and the semantic (based on Kripke frames) proofs.
3. Formalize Moore's paradox in full generality in S5/KD45 modal logic, both the syntactic and the semantic proofs.
4. Answer this question: if you wrap everything in the necessitation operator, can you turn K modal logic into S5 modal logic by defining "true" in S5 as "necessary" in K?
