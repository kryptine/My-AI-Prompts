Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please attempt to enumerate every possible substitution, to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations for all these content, to provide solutions to my requests below?
1. Please formalize the idea that the fixed-point theorems for non-transitive relations (the generalized fixed-point theorem in paper 2) and the fixed-point theorems for magmoidal categories with diagonals (all the major results in paper 4) can be reduced to Lawvere's fixed-point theorem, by creating proofs with fewer steps of these theorems that are able to take Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as a lemma or a hypothesis, unwrapped with universal quantifiers intact, by finding and explicitly describing and formalizing in theorem provers categorical constructions such as the presheaf category of magmoidal categories and the category of relations and using Day convolutions.
2. Please generalize the type-theoretic version of Tarski's fixed-point theorem to the general fixed-point theorem for non-transitive relations, instead of formalizing paper 2 and 3 as-is, use the type-theoretic structure of paper 3 to formalize paper 2 and reduce the results to special cases of the formalization.
