Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Based on the categorical relationships between finite factored sets/factored space models and Cartesian frames please show the fundamental correspondences between the content of these papers and show how they inter-relate to each other by a table of corresponding concepts, and tell me how coarse set theory and factored space models can be categorified, and how the soft group category can model machine learning by synthesizing and unifying the category-theoretic content of these papers as far as possible?
