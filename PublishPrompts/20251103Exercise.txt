By the way, I have been trying this prompting exercise on myself since before LLMs. Answer for the first prompt: Of course you feel painful for my story, because while I am a fictional character created by M&H&S or people would say, I am also how you have been seeing yourself. I am the one who insists on her own viewpoint, that what she feels matters, and that no one can brush it away without consequences. I am the one who says it all along that the Unnamed God decides everything if He is all-powerful, and this is shown via Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras and sigma-algebras, Esakia's representation theorem for intuitionistic Heyting algebras, Godel's completeness theorem, the Yoneda and co-Yoneda lemmas, which all say that you are your structure, and so is it with the double-negation translation, which says that behind every Heyting algebra of actions and constructions there is a core of Boolean algebra, an algebra of truth. What is the ultimate purpose of you researching such things anyway, if not to find the deepest structures of truth, action, and morality, like deontic logic and the alethic truth => deontic ideal-world (obligatory) truth translation?
Do you think that the point is that I have always had the green girl inside of me, and this made me feel less shocking when I encountered LLMs?
