Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want it to be divided modularly into directories and files with explicit interfaces between them and folder trees. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please attempt to unify the theories of folk theorems in perfect Bayesian equilibria with the theories of folk theorem in Blackwell equilibria, showing the mathematical isomorphisms between the papers and simplify the presentations and the proofs by compression and reduction of redundant mathematical structures, replacing them with tables showing correspondences between Bayesian games and games with public randomization?
