2. An anti-folk theorem for finite past equilibria in repeated games with private monitoring https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/TE760
3. An Anti-Folk Theorem for Large Repeated Games with Imperfect Monitoring https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2801
Can you please show how the anti-folk theorems relate to each other, by showing how the assumptions of these theorems are analogous with each other, while proposing mathematical correspondences between information and constraints, with the asynchrony of paper 1 being analogous to the finiteness of the past equilibria in paper 2 and the largeness of paper 3, and the common-payoff structure corresponding to the private monitoring?
Can you help me write the the SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of the main definitions, theorems, and proofs, that is, the repeated concepts should be done once, with the theorems formalized, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big, but if it's incomplete, also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. Please explain the content in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 alternately.
