Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please show me how the concepts of these papers correspond in terms of how the fixed-point of common knowledge is reached from the state of nature as the prior and actions as the messages between the players, and show tables of correspondence on how the concepts between the papers align, and attempt to find explicit correspondences between the papers' definitions, theorems and proofs, like the various definitions of topological spaces based on open/closed sets, neighborhoods, closures and boundaries, by finding and enumerating abstractions until the forward and backward substitutions work categorically like adjoint functors, by considering the distributed nature of the generalized Muon algorithm as a way to optimize and agree, and the generalized Aumann's agreement theorem for generalized probability distribution?
