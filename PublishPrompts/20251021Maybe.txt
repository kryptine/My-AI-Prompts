What I mean is that, maybe the "monitoring vs. discounting" paper also gives an argument against IP mathematically, by linking IP enforcement with private monitoring by a single institution, also the "moral hazard" paper also provides the case of linear enforcement, which makes the cost of punishment be borne by everyone at the same time, what I mean is that IP laws only prevents use per good, invention or work, which is not the same as punishing the agent for not contributing, making the signal diffuse because when someone changes the contribution level, this happens to all consumptions, not a single aspect, right?
