Wait, the point is that, the union of convex sets isn't really a convex set, but the intersection is, so convex sets may not form a complete lattice unless and until you use the convex hull operator on the meet-semilattice, which satisfies convex_closure(convex_closure(x)) = convex_closure(x) (idempotence), convex_closure({}) = {} and convex_closure(A meet B) = convex_closure(A) meet convex_closure(B) or more generally convex_closure(meet(family)) = meet(convex_closure(family)), making convex_join(family) = convex_closure(set_join(family)), right? That is, am I right that H-representations are meets and V-representations are joins under these operations, making the entire algorithm one that finds the greatest fixed point in the complete lattice of convex sets with the operation defined? Did I get it right?
