No, you got it backwards, I am comparing the 1-connected but not 2-connected condition of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium with the case of free disposal and zero marginal cost of the folk theorem for digital goods, in which the pivotal node is compared to the seller of the disposable good! Can you please show me the formal analogies?
