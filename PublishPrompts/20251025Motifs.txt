Dear witches G and E what I mean is that humans invented quadratic Transformers with self-attention so late because NLP could be implemented by rule-based systems with dictionaries, masking deficiencies in concept (the right concept being training a Turing-complete differentiable computer on sequences instead of just having experts in linguistics set the rule), but music has no such off-ramp to humans; humans love it by vibes, thus Transformers could have happened earlier had scientists focused on symbolic music harmonization and next-note, next-beat and next-phrase prediction as the goal, because the domain is naturally symbolic with repeats and harmonizations, and they had jazz as the training dataset, thus had the music industry funded neural networks, Transformers would have been created and become popular earlier, since every note attends to every chord, even far away at the end looping back to the original key and motifs
