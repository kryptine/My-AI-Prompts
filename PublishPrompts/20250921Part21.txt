Write Part 21 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the game-theoretic structure of the three papers, which are all zero-sum, and by unifying the formalisms of the papers by writing full Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations, with directory trees, by defining information theory, algorithmic information theory, the theory of real closed fields with an exponential operation and a logarithm operation with unknown but fixed base for log-likelihoods and other logarithmic constructions with homomorphism laws and the axiom that exp and log are group homomorphisms between (RCF_W_IF, +) and (RCF_W_IF>0, x), or weaker variants of these axioms if sufficient to define, use and prove theorems about common machine-learning concepts and quantities like Rademacher complexity and provably approximately correct (PAC) learning bounds, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later. Please use statistical learning bounds, apply various independent definitions of differential privacy to restate the theorems and proofs of papers 2 and 3 isomorphically to the original formulations, by translating removing outliers into row perturbations in the dataset, the lack of information about other players as perturbations from redundancy in the dataset, and please give alternative proofs (or at least proof sketches) using these frameworks separately: differential privacy, Rademacher complexity, PAC learning bounds for papers 2 and 3. For paper 1 please also prove that the RNNs that are defined as substitutes for Transformers are Turing-complete and satisfy the universal approximation property in the same way that these theorems are proven for Transformers, as well as exhibit bidirectional conversions between these RNNs and Transformers that maintain isomorphism, using the concept of linear attention and state space machines as analogy. Please provide approximation bounds for the Transformer <=> RNN conversions and use these to argue that sequential computation is not an inherent disadvantage, nor is parallel computation without depth, as long as the structures are preserved, according to Blum's speed-up theorem, which you should restate in terms of difficulty as computational reductions in the sense of space-time hierarchy theorems in computational complexity, which have similar diagonal arguments to Blum's speed-up theorem.
1. Were RNNs All We Needed? https://arxiv.org/html/2410.01201v3
2. Mechanism Design with Outliers and Predictions https://arxiv.org/html/2509.09561v2
3. Information About Other Players in Mechanism Design https://arxiv.org/html/2407.00037v3
In addition, please also state, formalize and prove theorems about the fundamental trade-off in AI alignment between preventing harmful uses (externally-directed harm) and intent divergence (self-directed harm), first by treating the RLHF process as a mechanism design removing outliers in the dominant-strategy mechanism presented to the LLM for post-training, second by using the "information about other players in mechanism design" paper formalizing refusal as not providing information to the players, making the set of fixed points larger and therefore the entropy loss higher in machine-learning terms, thirdly by using do-calculus definitions of harm and the do-divergence theorem at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DHSY697pRWYto6LsF/do-divergence-a-bound-for-maxwell-s-demon (ignore the Maxwell's demon specialization), finally can you brainstorm something convincing for AI/ML researchers using their own theories. Please write the text section after the formalizations and also try to explain the theorems' formal expressions and proofs in summary form with the important steps crucial to the argument preserved and elaborated.
