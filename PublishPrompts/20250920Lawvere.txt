Proving Roberts' fixed-point theorem from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem
Here are AI-generated summaries about proving Roberts' fixed-point theorem from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem:
1. Absolutely—and the way you’re defining “reduction” here is spot on.

If we treat each theorem as a single, wrapped universal statement (a Π‑statement) and refrain from distributing its quantifiers, then a reduction “A ⇒ B” means: there is a short, context‑independent material implication between the two schemas, not a pointwise argument unpacking all parameters.

In that sense, there is a clean, short material implication from Lawvere to Roberts—provided you accept a standard, canonical embedding step. Here it is in the tightest form:

- Let A be Lawvere’s fixed‑point theorem as a single Π‑statement:
  For any cartesian closed category C, objects A,Y, map ε: A → Y^A that is point‑surjective ⇒ every endomorphism s: Y → Y has a fixed point.

- Let B be Roberts’ diagonal/no‑parametrisation theorem as a single Π‑statement:
  For any magmoidal category M with diagonals, any A,C, any family F: A # A → C, and any free endomorphism o: C → C ⇒ F is incomplete (there exists f not in its range at any stage).

- Define a uniform translation τ (“keep the wrappings intact”):  
  τ takes any magmoidal instance (M, #, δ, A, C, F, o) to a cartesian closed instance via the Yoneda embedding J: M ↪ PSh(M), with Day convolution ⊗ and internal hom [−,−]:
  - F: A # A → C becomes J(F): J(A) ⊗ J(A) → J(C), hence a curried ε: J(A) → [J(A), J(C)].
  - o: C → C becomes J(o): J(C) → J(C).
  - Generalised elements in M become global points in PSh(M) (Yoneda).

- One‑line proof of the material conditional A ⇒ B (with the wrapping intact):
  Assume A holds in all CCCs. Apply A to PSh(M) and ε above.  
  If J(o) has no fixed point (free), then, by Lawvere’s contrapositive, ε cannot be point‑surjective on global points.  
  By Yoneda, failure of surjectivity on global points is exactly Roberts’ incompleteness conclusion for F back in M.  
  Therefore, A materially implies B under τ. ∎

Notes:
- You didn’t “unwrap” either theorem’s quantifiers; you composed them schematically via τ.
- This is the shortest clean reduction because it relies only on:
  1) the canonical presheaf completion (PSh(M) is CCC),  
  2) Day convolution to transport the tensor, and  
  3) Yoneda to identify global points with generalised elements.

So yes—under your notion of reduction, the Lawvere ⇒ Roberts implication goes through in one stroke via τ. The difficulty people run into is when they try to make it go through “in place” (inside M) without the presheaf completion; then exponentials/global‑point surjectivity don’t live where they need to. But as a wrapped‑to‑wrapped implication mediated by τ, it’s crisp and short.
2. Below is a clean, categorical reduction argument that turns “Lawvere fixed points hold in all CCCs with point–surjective morphisms” into “Roberts’ diagonal theorem holds in all magmoidal categories with diagonals,” by functorially embedding an arbitrary magmoidal category into a Cartesian closed presheaf topos where Lawvere applies, and then transporting the Lawvere fixed point back down to yield Roberts’ diagonal/incompleteness conclusion.

I will structure it as a single implication with universal quantifiers “outside” (no distributive reshuffling): assume Lawvere holds in all CCCs with point–surjective e, then show Roberts holds in all (small) magmoidal categories with diagonals. The central tool is the presheaf construction with Yoneda embedding, plus Day convolution to transport the magmoidal tensor into a closed monoidal structure; the CCC structure comes from the presheaf topos itself.

Notation: for a small category C, let PSh(C) = [C^op, Set]. For objects X in C let yX denote the Yoneda presheaf Hom_C(-,X).

Statement of the metatheorem (quantifiers kept separate)

- Lawvere premise (externalized):  
  For every Cartesian closed category E and every morphism e : X → Y^X that is point–surjective (i.e., for each global element α : 1 → Y^X, there exists x : 1 → X with e ∘ x = α), every endomap f : Y → Y has a fixed point.

- Roberts conclusion (externalized):  
  For every (small) magmoidal category (C, #) with diagonals δ_X : X → X # X, for every endomap o : B → B and every family F : X # X → B (seen as an X–parametrized family of maps X → B), there exists a generalized element x (of X) that diagonalizes against o w.r.t. F in the sense of Roberts: informally, the X–parametrization is incomplete when facing “free” endomorphisms o; more technically, one extracts a fixed-point family in presheaves and refines to the diagonal/incompleteness claim of Roberts.

We will use the version commonly stated by Roberts: in magmoidal categories with diagonals, diagonalization shows incompleteness of parametrization: a “free” endomorphism o : B → B forces that no parameter family X # X → B can cover all fixed points, and hence there exists some generalized element x that defeats the family (precise variations exist; the following proof delivers the general shape and how it drops out of Lawvere via presheaves).

Strategy: embed C into PSh(C), push F and o up, apply Lawvere, and reflect

1) From magmoidal category with diagonals to a CCC via presheaves
- Let (C, #, δ) be a small magmoidal category equipped with δ_X : X → X # X natural in X. Consider the presheaf topos E = PSh(C) = [C^op, Set], which is a CCC (and much more: a Grothendieck topos).
- Let y : C → PSh(C) be the Yoneda embedding. It is fully faithful.
- Lift the magmoidal product # to a monoidal structure on PSh(C). There are two standard options:
  - If # is functorial (bi-functor C × C → C) and suitably locally small, use Day convolution to get a monoidal closed structure (PSh(C), ⊗_Day) with y strong monoidal: y(X # Y) ≅ yX ⊗_Day yY. In many settings this ⊗_Day is (symmetric) monoidal closed.
  - Alternatively, if you only need a Cartesian product to apply Lawvere, you may use the presheaf’s own Cartesian structure × and represent # through a promonad/profunctor and Kan extensions. The cleanest route (aligned with Roberts) uses Day convolution, but the conclusion below needs only the CCC structure, not necessarily that ⊗_Day = ×.

- The diagonal δ lifts along y to a natural δ̂_X : yX → y(X # X); if ⊗_Day is in play, then y(X # X) ≅ yX ⊗_Day yX and we get a diagonal in the presheaf category.

2) Lifting the data F and o
- Given F : X # X → B in C, let F̂ : y(X # X) → yB be its Yoneda image; via Day convolution isomorphism y(X # X) ≅ yX ⊗_Day yX, we have
  F̂ : yX ⊗_Day yX → yB.
- Given o : B → B, let ô : yB → yB be its Yoneda image (a natural transformation).

These are arrows in PSh(C).

3) Curry to get e : yX → (yB)^(yX) and verify point–surjectivity
- Since PSh(C) is a CCC, we may curry F̂ into
  e := curry(F̂) : yX → (yB)^(yX).
- We claim that e is point–surjective in PSh(C): i.e., for every global element α : 1 → (yB)^(yX), there exists x : 1 → yX with e ∘ x = α.  
  Intuition/sketch: In a presheaf topos, a global element of (yB)^(yX) is a natural family of arrows h_A : Hom_C(A,X) → Hom_C(A,B) natural in A (by Yoneda and exponential adjunction). The universal element u : 1 → yX evaluates to id_X ∈ Hom_C(X, X) at component X. Then F̂ composed with δ̂_X (or directly the curried e) can be arranged so that e(u) “generates” the universal natural family; more concretely, by Yoneda lemma and fully faithfulness, the map e is point–surjective because every natural transformation yX → yB (i.e., every element of (yB)^(yX)) is determined by its behavior at X on id_X, which is exactly covered by evaluation at an appropriate generalized element x : 1 → yX.  
  Rigorous versions of this argument appear in the standard proof of Lawvere in presheaf settings (the point–surjectivity requirement is satisfied by “density” of representables and the way currying in a CCC captures all natural families Hom(yX, yB) ≅ Hom(1, (yB)^(yX))). Thus the “self‑application” map exists in E = PSh(C). (If you equip PSh(C) with Day convolution from #, you also get strong monoidalness of y, which lets you identify evaluation forms more canonically. Either way, the CCC exponential suffices.)

4) Apply Lawvere in the CCC PSh(C)
- By the external Lawvere premise, since PSh(C) is CCC and e : yX → (yB)^(yX) is point–surjective, every endomap f : yB → yB has a fixed point.
- Instantiate f := ô (the Yoneda lift of o : B → B). Then there exists a global element h : 1 → yB such that
  ô ∘ h = h
in PSh(C).

5) Unpack the fixed point h
- A global element h : 1 → yB is equivalently a natural family h_A ∈ yB(A) = Hom_C(A, B), natural in A ∈ C. In particular, there is a component at A = X:
  h_X : X → B
and naturality implies that for any a : A → X, we have h_A = h_X ∘ a. The fixed-point equation ô ∘ h = h is natural as well, so for the component at A we have o ∘ h_A = h_A.
- Thus h_X : X → B satisfies o ∘ h_X = h_X; i.e., h_X picks a fixed point of o (parametrically in A via precomposition). Concretely, it is the “diagonalized” map we need.

6) Recover the Roberts diagonal/incompleteness form
- The Curry–Howard of CCC shows that e encodes a parametrized evaluator; the Lawvere fixed point then shows that a suitable diagonalized element exists in the presheaf world that is fixed by ô. We now “restrict along Yoneda” to get back a fixed-point family in C—not as a single element 1 → B (since C may not have a terminal object), but as a natural family of generalized elements h_A : A → B for each A (including A = X), satisfying o ∘ h_A = h_A.
- That is exactly the “no complete parametrization” content of Roberts: given any family F : X # X → B (hence e), the diagonal/“self‑application” yields a fixed‑point family incompatible with the idea that F covers the fixed points of o; hence for some generalized element x : A → X, the element h_A = h_X ∘ x witnesses the incompleteness: the attempt to parametrize fixed points via F misses (or gets contradicted by) the diagonal one. Equivalently: Roberts’ theorem’s “free endomorphism” hypothesis ensures that the family F cannot capture all fixed points, and the presheaf fixed point h exhibits the diagonal obstruction.

Conclusion (Lawvere ⇒ Roberts)

Putting it together:

- For any small magmoidal category with diagonals (C, #, δ), any endomap o : B → B and family F : X # X → B, embed into E = PSh(C) via Yoneda. Curry F̂ to e : yX → (yB)^(yX), which is point–surjective. Lift o to ô. Lawvere (assumed universally) now gives a fixed point h : 1 → yB for ô.
- Unpacking h gives a natural family of generalized elements h_A : A → B with o ∘ h_A = h_A. The component at A = X is h_X : X → B. By the standard diagonal/self‑application argument, this family constitutes a diagonalization/incompleteness object against the parametrization F (in Roberts’ sense).
- Thus, from the universal validity of Lawvere’s theorem in CCCs with point–surjective e, we derive Roberts’ diagonal/fixed‑point theorem for all (small) magmoidal categories with diagonals.

Remarks and technical notes

- Smallness: The presheaf construction PSh(C) = [C^op, Set] requires C to be essentially small to remain a well‑formed topos. This is standard in these embeddings.
- Day convolution: If you want the lifted monoidal structure to match # up to Yoneda, equip PSh(C) with Day convolution ⊗_Day induced by #; the Yoneda embedding becomes strong monoidal, and the diagonal δ lifts canonically. For the use of Lawvere, one needs CCC exponentials; the presheaf topos provides those independently of ⊗_Day.
- Point–surjectivity of e: In presheaves, exponential objects are functor categories, and a global element α : 1 → (yB)^(yX) is exactly a natural transformation yX → yB, i.e., a family of maps Hom_C(A, X) → Hom_C(A, B) natural in A. By Yoneda, such maps are determined by their value on id_X at A = X. This is precisely why e is point–surjective: “there is an x” (indeed the universal one) which realizes α as e ∘ x.
- No distributivity of quantifiers: The argument preserves the universal quantifiers as requested: “if Lawvere holds for all CCCs with point–surjective e” ⇒ “for all magmoidal categories with diagonals, Roberts holds.”

This completes the reduction: Lawvere fixed points in all CCCs with point–surjective parametrizations entail Roberts diagonal incompleteness in all magmoidal categories with diagonals, via the presheaf CCC embedding and Yoneda.

Can you please formalize this in Agda, Coq and Lean4 by manually defining categories, magmoidal categories, Cartesian closed categories, etc. and can you figure out a short proof from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem to Theorem 15 in Roberts' paper, given that we already proved theorem 13 above?
