Can you explain the APS construction in precise mathematical terms for n players with generalized Python code based on the provided code for me? Is my claim that the APS construction as implemented at https://github.com/jasmina-karabegovic/IRGames/blob/master/irgames.py and described in https://arxiv.org/html/2411.01566v1 is conceptually similar to the "greatest fixed point" Kleene/Knaster-Tarski/Bourbaki-Witt fixed-point theorems accurate?
