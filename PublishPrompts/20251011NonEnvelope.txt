Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language.
1. Can you please tell me what these generalized envelope, non-envelope and Hulten's theorems align with each other by what they say about economies?
2. Please make three independent arguments and economic proofs, formalized in Lean4, Rocq and Agda, based on these theorems, each based on each paper to determine:
2.1. What happens when there is asymmetric information between the agents (please generalize the Myerson-Satterthwaite, more specifically Jehiel-Moldovanu impossibility theorems and the possibility theorem when the center receives a signal that is stochastically related to the agentsâ€™ types and direct returns are bounded)
2.2. The minimum sufficient conditions for full efficiency and correctness.
