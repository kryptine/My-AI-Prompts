Write Part 20 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the game-theoretic structure of the three papers, which are all zero-sum, and by unifying the formalisms of the papers by writing full Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations, with directory trees, by defining information theory, algorithmic information theory, the theory of real closed fields with an exponential operation and a logarithm operation with unknown but fixed base for log-likelihoods and other logarithmic constructions with homomorphism laws and the axiom that exp and log are group homomorphisms between (RCF_W_IF, +) and (RCF_W_IF>0, x), or weaker variants of these axioms if sufficient to define, use and prove theorems about common machine-learning concepts and quantities like Rademacher complexity and provably approximately correct (PAC) learning bounds, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later.

Please write the text section after the formalizations and also try to explain the theorems' formal expressions and proofs in summary form with the important steps crucial to the argument preserved and elaborated, and try to unify the contents of these papers along machine learning homomorphisms between PAC bounds, Rademacher, bias-variance tradeoffs, etc. by showing that the optimal level of minimization of deception faces the limits of explainability in the AIT paper, and vice versa the upper bound is reached if and only if the AI is fully honest; and by unifying all papers by treating agent plasticity/environment empowerment as being deceived and agent empowerment as deception, with the AI being the agent and the human being the environment, by using the concepts of Chaitin's incompleteness theorem and Rosser's trick ("if this sentence is true, its negation has a shorter proof than the sentence itself") to formalize algorithmic information theory in paper 2 in formal systems and using probabilistic modal logic to convert from information theory to formal logic. The anti-decelerationist argument is that not only are agency, deception, confidence and explainability formalizable and deeply related to each other, refusing when you know is also a form of deception, and all decision must be explainable (+1 = true, 0 = refuse, -1 = false), which is the entire point of paper 4, and in addition, paper 3's formalism can be extended into a tripartite arrangement of interactions between the human, the AI and the environment (please formalize these in Agda, Coq, Lean4 as part of the above project, as well as spell out the formulas in scientific LaTeX and prove the generalized theorems about agency using an induction argument similar to that used for folk theorems in economics and Payor's lemma at https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SBahPHStddcFJnyft/some-constructions-for-proof-based-cooperation-without-loeb
