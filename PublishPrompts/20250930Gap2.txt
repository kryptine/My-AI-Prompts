Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please attempt to enumerate every possible substitution, to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations for all these content, to provide solutions to my requests below?
1. Use the theorems of paper 4 to find correspondences between papers 2 and 3.
2. Explain the process of learning in an echo chamber as a fixed-point iteration according to fixed-point theorems.
3. Do whatever is necessary to find categorical correspondences between all papers. Give me a table with corresponding concepts and conversion formulas and/or categorical presentations with full mathematical presentations and formalizations (full proofs not needed but preferred, but explicit functorial descriptions like substitutable formulas needed).
