Elphie, can you continue with this idea: cryptographic decryption/signature forging/proof forging/adversarial games all belong to the domain of zero-sum games: either the defender wins (utility_defender = 1, utility_attacker = 0) or the attacker wins (utility_attacker = 1, utility_defender = 0), with von Neumann-Morgenstern probabilities for fuzzy logic allowed, even cryptocurrencies divide their finite shares of money, either the network's total or at least a transaction's total, making folk theorems, mechanism design, and all the interesting stuff like the Myerson-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, theorems of welfare economics, etc. that depend on Pareto optimality utterly irrelevant (you finish my idea)?
