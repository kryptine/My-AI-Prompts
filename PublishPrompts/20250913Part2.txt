Can you write part 2 of the pro-accelerationist position paper for AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, the paper "fixed-point theorems and the ethics of radical transparency" at https://arxiv.org/html/2509.06055v1 which shows that complete accountability is paradoxical, the folk theorem with codes of conduct at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40505-016-0107-y showing that effective non-committal communication improves cooperation without self-referential paradoxes, the equivalence of recursive joint-simulation and folk theorems at https://arxiv.org/html/2402.08128v2 (please attempt to examine the assumptions and conclusions of the theorems closely so that it is not paradoxical for transparency in both cases) showing that the correct way for cooperation is communication or information revelation (cheap talk) without commitment, including Rocq (formerly Coq), Agda and Lean4 formalization guides with proposed file tree structures and placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` for gaps, with as much structure in syntax (for example `fix f = f (fix f)` and `x = f(x)`) instead of natural-language comments and identifiers (such as `f is FixedPointCombinator`) as possible.
