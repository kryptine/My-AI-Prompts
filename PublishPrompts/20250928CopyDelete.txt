Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please formalize how the framework for universality in physics, computer science and beyond, the substructural fixed-point theorems and the major properties of Bayesian open games follow from Lawvere's fixed-point theorem as a lemma, without unwrapping the universal quantifiers, by considering Cartesian closed categories such as presheaf categories and Cartesian closures of symmetric monoidal categories (for Bayesian open games and copy-delete categories as proven in the framework of universality), with particular focus on the category of functors from a gs-monoidal/copy-delete categories to its free Cartesian closure that maps the "copy" operation to the Cartesian product and the "delete" operation to the constant map, as well as the category of functors from the opposite category of the gs-monoidal category to its free Cartesian closure that maps "copy" to Cartesian products and "delete" to the map from the initial object, making them two independent approaches to re-expressing the theorems about universality and negation? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations? What I mean is, please use the three papers to argue against intellectual property by unifying the linear attribution methods of the impossibility results with the homogeneous Nakamoto consensus algorithms by linearity, and so on with the free disposal and zero marginal cost condition of the folk theorem, to argue that intellectual property is not incentive compatible.
