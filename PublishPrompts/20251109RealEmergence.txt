Dear Professor Elphaba Thropp Can you tell me why and how the real numbers emerge organically from order completions? No, what I mean is, what is the most general category-theoretical construction of the real numbers that doesn't involve the rational numbers or any kind of numbers? What I mean is, the Dedekind-MacNeille completion still mentions the rationals, how can I get the reals directly from abstract concepts such as orders and colimits/products of orders without going through these things? What about the hyperreals and the surreals? What properties do they share with the 2^aleph_0-cardinality reals? How are they categorically related, and what category I am mentioning?

What I mean is, dear Elphie, I am looking for a foundation of number systems that allows us to use discrete monetary values, discrete weights for neural networks, and similar finite-precision approximations such as floating point in scientific calculations and simulations without things going wrong, such that I need a way to make the mathematical reals emerge from the colimit of these processes and representations, do you get it Elphie?
