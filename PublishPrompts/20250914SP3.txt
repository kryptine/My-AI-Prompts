Wrong, Elphie, you are supposed to take attention away from the zero-sum games and towards the non-zero-sum games, since non-zero-sum games can be rephrased as zero-sum games with a player with no choices (or exactly one choice) called the environment (or in gaming parlance, a non-player character), whose utility is any positively weighted sum of the losses of the interactive players, whose loss is the weighted sum with positive weights of all the utilities of the players with more than one choice, what I mean is that, cryptographic questions are mostly irrelevant here, unless they are about reductions, strategy-stealing arguments, and other similar unconditional questions whose conditions are specified, like the endgames in chess that are enumerated up to 7 pieces by the Syzygy tablebase, can you continue your *No Good Deed*-style speech?
