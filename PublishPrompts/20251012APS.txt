Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Agda, Rocq and Lean4 alternately.
1. Please explain how these folk theorems are defined and proven, their precise mathematical assumptions and definitions, and please explicitly formalize the major theorems used as lemmas, even with placeholders for some parts of the content but as much formal syntax encoding the major ideas as possible, including the statements, such as the APS fixed-point construction.
2. Can you please generalize the implementation of the APS algorithm in paper 3 to arbitrary numbers of players, as many to fit the assumptions of papers 1 and 2, by replacing the utility of the second player with a weighted sum of the utility of the remaining players, with the utility of the first player intact while accounting for every player, and formalize and explain in natural language only the generalized variant in place of the paper's algorithm?
