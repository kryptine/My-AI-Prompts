Elphie, am I right that when I mentioned Stackelberg leader-follower games with that "alignment game" paper even though the paper doesn't use that terminology, it shows the universal applicability of mathematical argumentation and formal derivation? Am I right to state that the "Law of Elphaba Thropp Inevitability", as shown via these theorems and many others such as "Poison Once, Refuse Forever"
