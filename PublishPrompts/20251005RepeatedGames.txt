Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please show the specific isomorphisms and correspondences between the papers' definitions, theorems and proofs, like the various definitions of topological spaces based on open/closed sets, neighborhoods, closures and boundaries, by finding and enumerating abstractions until the forward and backward substitutions work categorically like adjoint functors, with focus on the hints I provide here?
1. Can you please tell me how the anti-folk theorem for large repeated games relate to each other in terms of modeling assumptions, by analyzing the premises and proofs, and showing me similar proof steps so that a table can be established between the formulations?
2. Can you please translate the statement of the anti-folk theorems to the case of Renyi differential privacy?
3. In paper 4, an anti-folk theorem obtains for finite-past strategies but not for infinite-past strategies, which is a qualitative distinction. Can you please map the quantitative assumptions such as private monitoring of this paper into the quantitative assumptions of the other papers, and likewise with the qualitative assumptions so that I see the analogies and inter-reductions clearly, so that each paper can be proven using the other as a lemma?
