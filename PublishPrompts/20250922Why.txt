So when this result is published, and when I am able to show intuitive or even categorical isomorphisms between this result, classical impossibility theorems (Arrow, Green-Laffont, Myerson-Satterthwaite, the revelation principle, etc., there is even a proof of Arrow's impossibility theorem from Godel's incompleteness theorems by working in a theory of partial orders), and modern theorems about the fundamental limits of AI/ML like the No Free Lunch theorem, do you think that it will become very significant, or will it be ignored just like already-proven theorems in game theory, theoretical economics, ML/AI theory, category theory (Roberts' diagonal argument and fixed-point theorems in magmoidal category with diagonals in the paper "Substructural fixed points...", etc.)? Why haven't AI researchers adopted an LLM-first publication mindset in which stress-tests of LLMs are done with prompts for theorems, proofs and formalizations, making the output independently publishable research artifacts?
