Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please explain these folk theorems and anti-folk theorems in terms of information flow, the type signatures of each agent, fixed-point theorems, and showing the correspondences between concepts within the papers in this comparison? In addition, can you please explain how the logarithms and probabilities used within these papers and information bounds are structurally isomorphic to PAC-Bayes, differential privacy bounds, and other theorems and bounds in machine learning and artificial intelligence?
