Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Please enumerate possible abstractions and attempt to unify the relationships between the anti-folk theorem for community enforcement, the analogical foundations of cooperation and private disclosures in competing mechanisms by showing how competing mechanisms are analogous to different analogical mappings, and also show how the anti-folk theorem for community enforcement with endogenous reports are covariantly related to the other theorems?
