Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Agda, Rocq and Lean4 alternately.
1. Please use the natural transformation to translate the constructions and theorems using the compactness theorem in the paper "to infinity and beyond" to the completeness theorem and category theory.
2. Please explain and formalize the APS construction for folk theorems, and attempt to use the "to infinity and beyond" framework to generalize it to infinitely many actions by defining a first-order theory in which long-run strategies are functions that can take other functions representing delayed strategies, or suggest another method. Please formalize it at least in the language of the paper.
3. Can you please apply the 1.75/L bound (both directions) to the convex optimization problem induced by the APS structure?
