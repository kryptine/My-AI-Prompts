Before helping me formalize, please reasonably answer these questions regarding the contents of these papers:
1. The paper about large repeated games talks about linear perfect equilibria, which models collective incentive provision. What are the equivalent concepts in the other papers, and can you spell out the definitions of linear perfect equilibria and related concepts to show how they model collective incentive provision?
2. Can linear perfect equilibria be related to private monitoring conceptually or even formally in terms of other players not being able to observe the results of the monitoring? Can you come up with formulas relating these concepts?
3. What are the major insights derived from the contents of these paper when it comes to convergence of monitoring structures as we vary the number of players, the monitoring structure and the discount factor? Note that I use the convention for the discount factor as the "importance-of-future factor" in which 0 represents one-shot games and 1 represents infinite-future games. Please notate this variable as lowercase gamma and relate my definition with the paper's. Also, please denote as K = ln(N) the natural logarithm of the number of players and adapt the formulas accordingly.
Please spell out the steps of the proofs present within the papers in the formalizations, with only omitted details replaced with placeholders
Can you help me write the Agda, Isabelle/HOL and Lean4 formalizations of these papers as far and comprehensively as possible, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in Agda, Isabelle/HOL and Lean4 alternately.
