Requests:
1. Explain how the right to know, the right to freedom of thought, and similar ideas about the right to have information is formalized within the various frameworks of deontic logic, and please give detailed natural-language explanations without examples or any illustrations more specific than the general formulations, theorems and proofs within the papers. Tell me the fundamental theorems about these rights, their limits, contradictions, paradoxes and when they arise as a necessity.
2. Can you help me write the the SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of the main definitions, theorems, and proofs, that is, the repeated concepts should be done once, with the theorems formalized, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big, but if it's incomplete, also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. Please explain the content in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 alternately.
