Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please show the corresponding incentive, punishment, information, etc. structures of the folk theorems side-by-side, so that I can see clearly what is going on within the papers? That is, can you compare the different approaches to handling logical uncertainty (the pragmatics of logical omniscience, logical induction, the bounded Lob's theorem, Blum's complexity axioms and speed-up theorem, relativizable computational complexity - Savitch's theorem, the spacetime speedup theorems, the arithmetical hierarchy's closure and diagonalization properties, etc.) and find their commonalities (cost metrics, distance, equivalence under induction - Savitch's theorem, logical induction's self-trust, universal Turing machines, inexploitability - undecidability of the halting problem, inexploitability of logical induction, Lobian cooperation, etc.) so as to form tables, and can you please use the model theories of modal logic, logical omniscience and probabilistic logic to attempt to find sandwich bounds for equivalence between the theories, by first forming the table of correspondences?
