1. Impossibility results for theorem attribution https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11870 https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304406120 show that any feature attribution method that is complete and linear provably fails to improve on random guessing for inferring model behavior, a No Free Lunch theorem variant for structureless optimization methods.

Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please use logical induction and infra-Bayesian searches, which are the same method of enumerating all your options like AIXI and Levin's universal search and Blum's speed-up theorem to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations? What I mean is, please use the three papers to argue against intellectual property by unifying the linear attribution methods of the impossibility results with the homogeneous Nakamoto consensus algorithms by linearity, and so on with the free disposal and zero marginal cost condition of the folk theorem, to argue that intellectual property is not incentive compatible.
