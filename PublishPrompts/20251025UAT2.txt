The problem is, should I publish a mission paper on arXiv to say that the various folk theorems, revelation principles, UATs, stability theorems, fixed-point theorems, categorical representation theorems, etc. show that the real domain of these theorems is no longer economics, ML/AI, category theory, or abstract mathematics but is in fact universal algebra, HoTT, mathematical logic and theorem proving? The question is, I can only write a call-to-arms now to insist that a new research grant or mission be established to find meta-universality theorems and possibly meta-meta-universality theorems about embedded agents modeling their own universe using formal languages like natural language, I smell a short exact sequence from specifics (0) -> algorithm -> meta-modeling criteria for algorithms -> laws of particular universes -> specifics here. By the way, am I right that the level of 2-theory is the appropriate level here, since once we attain that level we can generalize to infinity-theories by induction and then reframe the entire infinite,1-category as another description of the laws of the universe?
