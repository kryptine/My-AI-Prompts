Formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure such as information theory, derivatives and other mathematical claims into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial MVP, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it. Write Part 7 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem and its generalization as described in the paper "Substructural fixed-point theorems and the diagonal argument: theme and variations" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00239v2 whose summary is at https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/Diagonal.tex and which can be applied to the paper "Natural latents: latent variables stable across ontologies" at https://arxiv.org/html/2509.03780v1 by defining the category of natural latents with morphisms as mediations and proving that the category is Cartesian and therefore magmoidal, the generalized Koopman-Pitman-Darmois theorem at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvzW46Z3BsaZsLc25/natural-abstractions-key-claims-theorems-and-critiques-1 and the paper "Homotopy types of topological stacks of categories" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02778v2 showing that isomorphisms and alignment are inevitable for modelling the world when multiple agents do so?
