That's not quite it, what I mean is that the failure of the folk theorem in the connected but not 2-connected network is related to the folk theorem in digital goods with a single controlling node, and both cases show the exact same insight, when information is centralized, that node controls everything, like Arrow's impossibility theorem, and we lose decentralized cooperation, because in the case of the failure of the folk theorem we get failure of cooperation as the absence of a folk theorem, and in the case of digital goods we get the folk theorem in which the seller can get very high revenue as the failure of cooperation!
