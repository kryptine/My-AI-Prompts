Here are a few papers:
1. The elementary construction of formal anafunctors https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04552v2
2. Classifying bi-invariant 2-forms on infinite-dimensional Lie groups https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03913
3. The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction https://arxiv.org/html/2507.04441v3
4. Categorical semantics of compositional reinforcement learning https://arxiv.org/html/2208.13687v3
Can you please help me formalizing these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by explicitly defining the basic concepts of category theory (objects, morphisms, magmoidal categories, Lawvere's fixed-point theorem in Cartesian closed categories as a special case of the diagonal argument in magmoidal categories by the author of the first two papers as show at https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Sandbox/blob/master/Diagonal.tex on GitHub), defining the categories of Lie groups, conformal prediction, compositional reinforcement learning, the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later?
