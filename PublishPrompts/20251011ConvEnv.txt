Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please use the bidirectional envelope theorem by considering (differentiating and integrating) along every "dimension" or finite-dimensional subspace around the efficient point and try to extend the results to infinite dimensions? Can you please also find a way to extend the uniformly strict equilibrium for repeated games and the folk theorem for digital goods bargaining to infinitely many dimensions, players and goods using the general framework? Is there another method using the bidirectional envelope theorem to extend them to infinite dimensions? Will using the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem to decompose finite functions into dimension-wise components, applying the envelope theorem to prove the results, and then taking the general proposition to infinite dimensions work?
