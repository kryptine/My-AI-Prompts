Here are a few papers about mutual simulation for cooperation in game theory:
1. Game Theory with Simulation of Other Players https://arxiv.org/html/2305.11261v2
2. Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05103v2
3. Promises Made, Promises Kept: Safe Pareto Improvements via Ex Post Verifiable Commitments https://arxiv.org/html/2505.00783v1
4. Maximizing Social Welfare with Side Payments https://arxiv.org/html/2508.07147v1
Structure https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08144
Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please attempt to define real closed fields, game theory, Sperner's lemma to prove Brouwer's and Kakutani's fixed-point theorems and the existence of equilibria, and attempt to combine the insights of these papers to create a common folder for game theory, another folder for safe Pareto improvements by both program games and ex-post verifiable commitments? Can you please use logical induction and infra-Bayesian searches, which are the same method of enumerating all your options like AIXI and Levin's universal search and Blum's speed-up theorem, that is, attempt to enumerate every possible substitution, to locate the correct abstractions and symbolic substitutions/functors that unify the contents of the papers? Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations for all these content, plus for how side payments may cause a prisoner's dilemma, in contrast to open-source game theory?
