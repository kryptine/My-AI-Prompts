No, what I mean is that if anything, the fundamental theorems of theoretical economics and game theory (the existence of Nash equilibria in infinite games according to Schauder's fixed-point theorem, the existence of equilibria for all individually-rational and feasible outcomes in repeated games - the folk theorems, their mirror the anti-folk theorems, Arrow's impossibility theorem - pay attention to the IIA assumption, the Myerson-Satterthwaite and Jehiel-Moldovanu impossibility theorems, the revelation and recommendation principles in economics) have proofs that are much simpler than the cryptographic assumptions themselves, plus the BGS oracle constructions also have the same diagonalization/completeness character for both P = PSPACE and P /= NP oracles, and that means that the impossibility and independence proofs here are in fact much more fundamental than whatever the resolution of P vs NP in our physical world is, and it turns out that when parties don't know each other, a third party must subsidize the trade (according to the Green-Laffont impossibility theorem and Moore's paradox in epistemic modal logic)
