Write Part 6 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the inconsistency of Moore sentences ("I know what you don't know") in S5 modal logic, Lob's theorem (If it is common knowledge that something is not common knowledge, it is common knowledge that the common knowledge of that proposition implies its truth by ex falso quodlibet, and since common knowledge is the least fixed point of mutual-knowledge recursion, it satisfies Lob's fixed-point condition, therefore Lob's theorem implies that the proposition itself is common knowledge) in Godel-Lob provability logic, Payor's lemma proven in modal logic and Kripke frames at https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wmJT2j3rdT8ngFkPN/self-referential-probabilistic-logic-admits-the-payor-s and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iCDBQtby4L2fZ7yns/payor-s-lemma-in-natural-language based on these papers:
1. Fixed-Point Theorems and the Ethics of Radical Transparency: A Logic-First Treatment https://arxiv.org/html/2509.06055v1
2. Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05765v2
3. From Hallucinations to Jailbreaks: Rethinking the Vulnerability of Large Foundation Models https://arxiv.org/html/2505.24232v1 am I right that this can also be differently formalized as the similarities between doxastic logic (hallucinations) and deontic logic (jailbreaks) when both can be represented with different modal operators (permission = possibility = diamond, obligation = necessity = square) and as two sides in a Stackelberg game (leader strategies = making the system misbelieve = hallucination, follower strategies = making the system go out of the way = jailbreaks)?
4. Parametric Bounded LÃ¶b's Theorem and Robust Cooperation of Bounded Agents https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04184 can you please attempt to reconcile this with the contents of the first paper by distinguishing between cheap talk (this paper) and credible commitments (the first paper) when both papers use fixed-point reflection of beliefs? Am I right that you can use the theory of paper 2, by using doxastic logic with reflexivity and deontic logic without reflexivity as competing modal operators within one system, to adjucate between papers 1 and 4?
Formalize only the formally proven theorems and associated algorithms and proofs within these papers to reformalize them in Agda, Rocq (formerly called Coq) and Lean4 and put as much structure such as information theory, derivatives and other mathematical claims into formal syntax as possible, instead of just natural language, allowing natural-language comments and identifiers only for explanation and clarification, not semantics, so that the article contains enough context and text that can be copy-pasted into other chats for further formalization, treating this as an initial MVP, with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if length doesn't allow it? If any paper doesn't contain a theorem, ignore it.
