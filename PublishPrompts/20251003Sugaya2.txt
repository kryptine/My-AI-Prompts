Can you tell me why every research direction about the folk theorems (other versions mentioning 2-connectedness of the communication structure as the necessary and sufficient condition for cooperation in games with private monitoring, these theorems showing how folk-theorem cooperation occurs in games that appear symmetric to every player due to lack of information) all points towards the same conclusion about the nature of information as the necessary and sufficient condition for cooperation in repeated games? Am I right to see the through-line here?
