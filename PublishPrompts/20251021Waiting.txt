I'm still waiting for a theoretical economist to directly model IP laws using multiple stacked goods, but the point is that maybe the best enforcement method for this particular problem, which can also pull in other kinds of non-profit charities such as political parties, is that you don't track whether someone pays to enter a particular community, but sum together how he contributes vs how he consumes. They say "pass it forward, not backward" for a reason.
