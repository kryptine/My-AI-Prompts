Please spell out the steps of the proofs present within the papers in the formalizations, with only omitted details replaced with placeholders
Can you help me write the initial section of the SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Please explain the syntheses in natural language and formal mathematical exposition in SMT-LIB 2, Agda, Coq and Lean4 alternately.
Can you tell me whether the fixed-point theorem (Theorem 15) in the first paper can be conceptually understood as an inversion or contrapositive of the summary "The diagonal argument redux", that is, a replacement of a statement from an inequality to another inequality (a != b => c != d) by an implication of an equality (c == d => a == b)? Can you please propose and formalize a homotopical (infinite-categorical) version of these theorems of magmoidal categories with diagonals, by replacing implications of equalities with constructors for paths? In addition, can you please explain higher-order pattern unification in terms of universal algebra for me?
