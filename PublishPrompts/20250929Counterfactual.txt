Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis. Can you please give natural-language explanations for your symbolic substitutions and their intuitive motivations and step-by-step explanations?
1. In addition to reducing Richens to Becker, can you therefore reduce Becker to Richens by using Pearl's do-calculus to define counterfactual harm so that we get two-way equivalence reductions in addition to the direction already present in the paper "counterfactual harm"? Can you use the minimax definitions to formalize the equivalence between the two systems?
2. What happens in the logic of counterfactuals paper when we allow the "defy" option? Can you prove a No Free Lunch theorem for this?
3. Can you please unify the logic of counterfactuals with the definition of harms by generalizing the theorems in 2405.11284 to arbitrarily many choices (n choices) and functions taken by the patient (n^n functions)? In addition, can you separate each patient into many patients by Cartesian products and try to make the theorems quantitative by using binary search to locate continuous values?
4. Can you please try to categorize in category theory these theories by using comma categories in which the source category contains all the reachable actions and the target category contains all the reachable results?
