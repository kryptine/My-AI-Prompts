Well, the point is that once you accept the multi-disciplinary convergence about the limits of pretending that you can cheat your own ignorance or exploit others' ignorance reliably when you are yourself ignorant, like the Dutch booker who is bound to polynomial time or the same complexity class as the logical inductor, or the language model that thinks it can model its own semantics and effect upon the world as in Tarski's undefinability theorem, you stop finding more alignment tricks and start aligning the system with your actual task as it is
