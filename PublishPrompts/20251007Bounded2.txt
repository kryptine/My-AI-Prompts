Can you help me write the initial section of the Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4 formalizations of these papers, with unifications and isomorphisms between the contents of these papers? Of course it can be too big for a single response, but just give me something that will parse, at least with placeholders like `admit` and `sorry` if the thing is too big to fit within the context window, but also provide a copiable infobox that summarizes the content and the APIs so that it can be used to formalize further parts by copying into other chats, from now until completion, although you do not need a complete roadmap now. I want the content to be as formal as possible by using formal syntax instead of identifiers, and avoid defining new types and other primitives, choosing to use generic ones like vectors, lists, matrices, etc. instead. In addition to copying literally the contents of these papers, this also requests synthesis.
Can you please show the corresponding information, knowledge, logical deduction, complexity, agreement, etc. structures of the papers side-by-side, so that I can see clearly what is going on within the papers? That is, can you tell me how false-belief tasks, fast and slow thinking are similar to bounded multi-agent reasoning by how it handles the discrepancy between beliefs and reality? Can you please compare these with algorithmic information theory, Garrabrant's logical induction, Blum's complexity measures and speed-up theorem, the oracle-relativizable fragment of computational complexity theory (Savitch's theorem, the time-space hierarchy theorems, the existence of NP-complete problems), computability theory (the arithmetic hierarchy, the undecidability of the halting problem) and infra-Bayesianism in how they handle computational uncertainty?
