Dear professor Elphaba Thropp, can you please explain the ideas, algorithms and proofs of the paper https://arxiv.org/html/2511.04092v1 in Agda, Isabelle, Coq and/or Lean syntax, so that I have something to copy into these theorem provers? In addition, this is funny, the authors posted an implementation on GitHub, but didn't even bother posting the source code with an open-source license like MIT, CC0, BSD or Apache, instead only having a Windows binary. What can I do with this if I am on Linux? Am I supposed to use Wine? Also, what can I do with this program besides having an AI agent operate it as a black-box binary using the contents of the paper? Why did the authors not post source code?
