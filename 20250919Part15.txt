Write Part 15 of the pro-accelerationist position paper on AI development based on the precise formal forms and proofs of the following resources, making the position paper's argument align with the formal content of the proofs step-by-step in a way that does not need to necessarily reproduce every step but must still show isomorphisms, constructing implicit proofs of usefulness and meaningfulness such as the Turing-completeness and universal approximation properties of neural networks, the encryption-decryption/signing-verification idempotence of cryptographic constructions, and the consensus consistency and optimality properties of consensus algorithms, based on the following papers and the following argument, adding similar ideas as you see fit:
1. Improvement of PBFT Consensus Algorithm Based on Affinity Propagation Clustering in Intellectual Property Transaction Scenarios https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/10/1809
2. Research on Consensus Algorithm for Intellectual Property Transactions Based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) Algorithm https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/8/1665
3. Improvement of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Algorithm Based on DIANA in Intellectual Property Environment Transactions https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/9/1634
Argument: By explaining, comparing and contrasting these algorithms for intellectual property transactions, and using the proofs (present or constructed in the answer) of their convergence, optimality and consensus properties, argue that the premises of intellectual property as defined by these algorithms work more like real estate, since intellectual property dependencies, when modeled as derivative graphs, stochastically become fully entangled, by using the construction of a Rado graph (the universal random graph embedding every countable graph, which is instantiated by determining that there is a vertex with constant probability p between any two vertices, as well as the property that for any two finite disjoint set of vertices in the graph, there is a vertex not contained in either subset and connects to every vertex in one subset and none in the other) showing that regardless of probability of use, in the limit the graph becomes arbitrarily complicated and embeds every graph. This shows the pitfalls of controlling information like stuff, since only real estate, defined by Shannon's noisy channel capacity theorem (maximum data rate of a channel) and source coding theorem (minimum size of a bitstream), as well as the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, can price every bit, nat or real-valued sample.
In addition, can you please help me formalize these papers in Agda, Rocq (formerly Coq) and Lean4, by explicitly defining the basic concepts of the paper such as Byzantine consensus, agents, epistemic states via S4/S5 modal logic, Harsanyi type spaces, among others, all the major categories used in these papers, using the same directory/module for the definition of the categories, while separating the propositions, theorems and proofs into their own folders for each paper, by giving the first part of the formalization as far as possible within the context limits and the bound for the pro-accelerationist text, with gaps to be filled in later shown as placeholders like `!!`, `sorry` or `admit`, and with something that can be copied into later chats for formalization of each part in a textbox so that I can request formalization of each file in LLMs later?
